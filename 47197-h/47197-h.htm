<h2><a name="SEVASTOPOL_IN_DECEMBER_1854" id="SEVASTOPOL_IN_DECEMBER_1854"></a>SEVASTOPOL IN DECEMBER, 1854.</h2>


<p>The flush of morning has but just begun to tinge
the sky above Sapun Mountain; the dark blue
surface of the sea has already cast aside the shades
of night and awaits the first ray to begin a play
of merry gleams; cold and mist are wafted from
the bay; there is no snow&#8212;all is black, but the
morning frost pinches the face and crackles
underfoot, and the far-off, unceasing roar of the
sea, broken now and then by the thunder of
the firing in Sevastopol, alone disturbs the calm
of the morning. It is dark on board the ships;
it has just struck eight bells.</p>

<p>Toward the north the activity of the day begins
gradually to replace the nocturnal quiet; here the
relief guard has passed clanking their arms, there
the doctor is already hastening to the hospital,
further on the soldier has crept out of his earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
hut and is washing his sunburnt face in ice-encrusted
water, and, turning towards the crimsoning
east, crosses himself quickly as he prays to
God; here a tall and heavy camel-wagon has
dragged creaking to the cemetery, to bury the
bloody dead, with whom it is laden nearly to the
top. You go to the wharf&#8212;a peculiar odor of
coal, manure, dampness, and of beef strikes you;
thousands of objects of all sorts&#8212;wood, meat, gabions,
flour, iron, and so forth&#8212;lie in heaps about
the wharf; soldiers of various regiments, with
knapsacks and muskets, without knapsacks and
without muskets, throng thither, smoke, quarrel,
drag weights aboard the steamer which lies
smoking beside the quay; unattached two-oared
boats, filled with all sorts of people,&#8212;soldiers,
sailors, merchants, women,&#8212;land at and leave the
wharf.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Grafsky, Your Excellency? be so
good.&#8221; Two or three retired sailors rise in their
boats and offer you their services.</p>

<p>You select the one who is nearest to you, you
step over the half-decomposed carcass of a brown
horse, which lies there in the mud beside the boat,
and reach the stern. You quit the shore. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
about you is the sea, already glittering in the
morning sun, in front of you is an aged sailor, in a
camel's-hair coat, and a young, white-headed boy,
who work zealously and in silence at the oars.
You gaze at the motley vastness of the vessels,
scattered far and near over the bay, and at the
small black dots of boats moving about on the
shining azure expanse, and at the bright and beautiful
buildings of the city, tinted with the rosy
rays of the morning sun, which are visible in one
direction, and at the foaming white line of the
quay, and the sunken ships from which black tips
of masts rise sadly here and there, and at the
distant fleet of the enemy faintly visible as they
rock on the crystal horizon of the sea, and at the
streaks of foam on which leap salt bubbles beaten
up by the oars; you listen to the monotonous
sound of voices which fly to you over the water,
and the grand sounds of firing, which, as it seems
to you, is increasing in Sevastopol.</p>

<p>It cannot be that, at the thought that you too
are in Sevastopol, a certain feeling of manliness,
of pride, has not penetrated your soul, and that the
blood has not begun to flow more swiftly through
your veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency! you are steering straight
into the Kistentin,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> says your old sailor to you as
he turns round to make sure of the direction which
you are imparting to the boat, with the rudder to
the right.</p>

<p>&#8220;And all the cannon are still on it,&#8221; remarks
the white-headed boy, casting a glance over the
ship as we pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course; it's new. Korniloff lived on board
of it,&#8221; said the old man, also glancing at the ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;See where it has burst!&#8221; says the boy, after a
long silence, looking at a white cloud of spreading
smoke which has suddenly appeared high
over the South Bay, accompanied by the sharp
report of an exploding bomb.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>He</i> is firing to-day with his new battery,&#8221; adds
the old man, calmly spitting on his hands. &#8220;Now,
give way, Mishka! we'll overtake the barge.&#8221;
And your boat moves forward more swiftly over
the broad swells of the bay, and you actually do
overtake the heavy barge, upon which some bags
are piled, and which is rowed by awkward soldiers,
and it touches the Grafsky wharf amid a multitude
of boats of every sort which are landing.</p>

<p>Throngs of gray soldiers, black sailors, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
women of various colors move noisily along the
shore. The women are selling rolls, Russian
peasants with samovárs are crying <i>hot sbiten</i>;<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
and here upon the first steps are strewn rusted
cannon-balls, bombs, grape-shot, and cast-iron
cannon of various calibers; a little further on is a
large square, upon which lie huge beams, gun-carriages,
sleeping soldiers; there stand horses,
wagons, green guns, ammunition-chests, and
stacks of arms; soldiers, sailors, officers, women,
children, and merchants are moving about; carts
are arriving with hay, bags, and casks; here and
there Cossacks make their way through, or officers
on horseback, or a general in a drosky. To the
right, the street is hemmed in by a barricade, in
whose embrasures stand some small cannon, and
beside these sits a sailor smoking his pipe. On
the left a handsome house with Roman ciphers on
the pediment, beneath which stand soldiers and
blood-stained litters&#8212;everywhere you behold the
unpleasant signs of a war encampment. Your
first impression is inevitably of the most disagreeable
sort. The strange mixture of camp and town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
life, of a beautiful city and a dirty bivouac, is not
only not beautiful, but seems repulsive disorder;
it even seems to you that every one is thoroughly
frightened, and is fussing about without knowing
what he is doing. But look more closely at the
faces of these people who are moving about you,
and you will gain an entirely different idea. Look
at this little soldier from the provinces, for example,
who is leading a troïka of brown horses to
water, and is purring something to himself so composedly
that he evidently will not go astray in
this motley crowd, which does not exist for him;
but he is fulfilling his duty, whatever that may be,&#8212;watering
the horses or carrying arms,&#8212;with
just as much composure, self-confidence, and
equanimity as though it were taking place in Tula
or Saransk. You will read the same expression
on the face of this officer who passes by in immaculate
white gloves, and in the face of the
sailor who is smoking as he sits on the barricade,
and in the faces of the working soldiers, waiting
with their litters on the steps of the former club,
and in the face of yonder girl, who, fearing to wet
her pink gown, skips across the street on the
little stones.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>Yes! disenchantment certainly awaits you, if
you are entering Sevastopol for the first time.
In vain will you seek, on even a single countenance,
for traces of anxiety, discomposure, or
even of enthusiasm, readiness for death, decision,&#8212;there
is nothing of the sort. You will see the
tradespeople quietly engaged in the duties of their
callings, so that, possibly, you may reproach yourself
for superfluous raptures, you may entertain
some doubt as to the justice of the ideas regarding
the heroism of the defenders of Sevastopol
which you have formed from stories, descriptions,
and the sights and sounds on the northern side.
But, before you doubt, go upon the bastions,
observe the defenders of Sevastopol on the very
scene of the defence, or, better still, go straight
across into that house, which was formerly the
Sevastopol Assembly House, and upon whose roof
stand soldiers with litters,&#8212;there you will behold
the defenders of Sevastopol, there you will behold
frightful and sad, great and laughable, but wonderful
sights, which elevate the soul.</p>

<p>You enter the great Hall of Assembly. You
have but just opened the door when the sight
and smell of forty or fifty seriously wounded men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and of those who have undergone amputation&#8212;some
in hammocks, the majority upon the floor&#8212;suddenly
strike you. Trust not to the feeling
which detains you upon the threshold of
the hall; be not ashamed of having come to
<i>look at</i> the sufferers, be not ashamed to approach
and address them: the unfortunates like
to see a sympathizing human face, they like to
tell of their sufferings and to hear words of
love and interest. You walk along between the
beds and seek a face less stern and suffering,
which you decide to approach, with the object of
conversing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you wounded?&#8221; you inquire, timidly
and with indecision, of an old, gaunt soldier,
who, seated in his hammock, is watching you with
a good-natured glance, and seems to invite you
to approach him. I say &#8220;you ask timidly,&#8221;
because these sufferings inspire you, over and
above the feeling of profound sympathy, with a
fear of offending and with a lofty reverence for
the man who has undergone them.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the leg,&#8221; replies the soldier; but, at the
same time, you perceive, by the folds of the coverlet,
that he has lost his leg above the knee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
&#8220;God be thanked now,&#8221; he adds,&#8212;&#8220;I shall get
my discharge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you wounded long ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was six weeks ago, Your Excellency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it still pain you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there's no pain now; only there's a sort of
gnawing in my calf when the weather is bad, but
that's nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you come to be wounded?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the fifth bastion, during the first bombardment.
I had just trained a cannon, and was on
the point of going away, so, to another embrasure
when <i>it</i> struck me in the leg, just as if
I had stepped into a hole and had no leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it not painful at the first moment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all; only as though something boiling
hot had struck my leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then&#8212;nothing; only the skin began to
draw as though it had been rubbed hard. The
first thing of all, Your Excellency, <i>is not to think
at all</i>. If you don't think about a thing, it
amounts to nothing. Men suffer from thinking
more than from anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, a woman in a gray striped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
dress and a black kerchief bound about her head
approaches you.</p>

<p>She joins in your conversation with the sailor,
and begins to tell about him, about his sufferings,
his desperate condition for the space of four
weeks, and how, when he was wounded, he made
the litter halt that he might see the volley from
our battery, how the grand-duke spoke to him
and gave him twenty-five rubles, and how he said
to him that he wanted to go back to the bastion
to direct the younger men, even if he could not
work himself. As she says all this in a breath,
the woman glances now at you, now at the sailor,
who has turned away as though he did not hear
her and plucks some lint from his pillow, and her
eyes sparkle with peculiar enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my housewife, Your Excellency!&#8221; the
sailor says to you, with an expression which
seems to say, &#8220;You must excuse her. Every one
knows it's a woman's way&#8212;she's talking nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>You begin to understand the defenders of
Sevastopol. For some reason, you feel ashamed
of yourself in the presence of this man. You
would like to say a very great deal to him, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
order to express to him your sympathy and
admiration; but you find no words, or you are
dissatisfied with those which come into your
head,&#8212;and you do reverence in silence before
this taciturn, unconscious grandeur and firmness
of soul, this modesty in the face of his own merits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, God grant you a speedy recovery,&#8221; you
say to him, and you halt before another invalid,
who is lying on the floor and appears to be
awaiting death in intolerable agony.</p>

<p>He is a blond man with pale, swollen face.
He is lying on his back, with his left arm thrown
out, in a position which is expressive of cruel
suffering. His parched, open mouth with difficulty
emits his stertorous breathing; his blue,
leaden eyes are rolled up, and from beneath the
wadded coverlet the remains of his right arm,
enveloped in bandages, protrude. The oppressive
odor of a corpse strikes you forcibly, and the
consuming, internal fire which has penetrated
every limb of the sufferer seems to penetrate
you also.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he unconscious?&#8221; you inquire of the
woman, who comes up to you and gazes at you
tenderly as at a relative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;No, he can still hear, but he's very bad,&#8221; she
adds, in a whisper. &#8220;I gave him some tea to-day,&#8212;what
if he is a stranger, one must still have
pity!&#8212;and he hardly tasted it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you feel?&#8221; you ask him.</p>

<p>The wounded man turns his eyeballs at the
sound of your voice, but he neither sees nor
understands you.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's a gnawing at my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little further on, you see an old soldier
changing his linen. His face and body are of a
sort of cinnamon-brown color, and gaunt as a
skeleton. He has no arm at all; it has been cut
off at the shoulder. He is sitting with a wide-awake
air, he puts himself to rights; but you see,
by his dull, corpse-like gaze, his frightful gauntness,
and the wrinkles on his face, that he is a being
who has suffered for the best part of his life.</p>

<p>On the other side, you behold in a cot the pale,
suffering, and delicate face of a woman, upon
whose cheek plays a feverish flush.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's our little sailor lass who was struck in
the leg by a bomb on the 5th,&#8221; your guide tells
you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> &#8220;She was carrying her husband's dinner to
him in the bastion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has it been amputated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They cut it off above the knee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, if your nerves are strong, pass through
the door on the left. In yonder room they are
applying bandages and performing operations.
There, you will see doctors with their arms blood-stained
above the elbow, and with pale, stern
faces, busied about a cot, upon which, with eyes
widely opened, and uttering, as in delirium, incoherent,
sometimes simple and touching words,
lies a wounded man under the influence of chloroform.
The doctors are busy with the repulsive
but beneficent work of amputation. You see the
sharp, curved knife enter the healthy, white body,
you see the wounded man suddenly regain consciousness
with a piercing cry and curses, you
see the army surgeon fling the amputated arm
into a corner, you see another wounded man,
lying in a litter in the same apartment, shrink
convulsively and groan as he gazes at the operation
upon his comrade, not so much from physical
pain as from the moral torture of anticipation.&#8212;You
behold the frightful, soul-stirring scenes; you
behold war, not from its conventional, beautiful,
and brilliant side, with music and drum-beat, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
fluttering flags and galloping generals, but you
behold war in its real phase&#8212;in blood, in suffering,
in death.</p>

<p>On emerging from this house of pain, you will
infallibly experience a sensation of pleasure, you
will inhale the fresh air more fully, you will feel
satisfaction in the consciousness of your health,
but, at the same time, you will draw from the
sight of these sufferings a consciousness of your
nothingness, and you will go calmly and without
any indecision to the bastion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do the death and sufferings of such an
insignificant worm as I signify in comparison with
so many deaths and such great sufferings?&#8221; But
the sight of the clear sky, the brilliant sun, the
fine city, the open church, and the soldiers moving
about in various directions soon restores your
mind to its normal condition of frivolity, petty
cares, and absorption in the present alone.</p>

<p>Perhaps you meet the funeral procession of
some officer coming from the church, with rose-colored
coffin, and music and fluttering banners;
perhaps the sounds of firing reach your ear from
the bastion, but this does not lead you back to
your former thoughts; the funeral seems to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
a very fine military spectacle, and you do not
connect with this spectacle, or with the sounds,
any clear idea of suffering and death, as you did
at the point where the bandaging was going on.</p>

<p>Passing the barricade and the church, you come
to the most lively part of the city. On both sides
hang the signs of shops and inns. Merchants,
women in bonnets and kerchiefs, dandified officers,&#8212;everything
speaks to you of the firmness of
spirit, of the independence and the security of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Enter the inn on the right if you wish to hear
the conversations of sailors and officers; stories
of the preceding night are sure to be in progress
there, and of Fenka, and the affair of the 24th,
and of the dearness and badness of cutlets, and of
such and such a comrade who has been killed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Devil take it, how bad things are with us to-day!&#8221;
ejaculates the bass voice of a beardless
naval officer, with white brows and lashes, in a
green knitted sash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asks another.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the fourth bastion,&#8221; replies the young officer,
and you are certain to look at the white-lashed
officer with great attention, and even with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
respect, at the words, &#8220;in the fourth bastion.&#8221;
His excessive ease of manner, the way he flourishes
his hands, his loud laugh, and his voice, which
seems to you insolent, reveal to you that peculiar
boastful frame of mind which some very young
men acquire after danger; nevertheless, you think
he is about to tell you how bad the condition of
things on the fourth bastion is because of the bombs
and balls. Nothing of the sort! things are bad because
it is muddy. &#8220;It's impossible to pass through
the battery,&#8221; says he, pointing at his boots, which
are covered with mud above the calf. &#8220;And my
best gun-captain was killed to-day; he was struck
plump in the forehead,&#8221; says another. &#8220;Who's that?
Mitiukhin?&#8221; &#8220;No!... What now, are they going
to give me any veal? the villains!&#8221; he adds to the
servant of the inn. &#8220;Not Mitiukhin, but Abrosimoff.
Such a fine young fellow!&#8212;he was in the
sixth sally.&#8221;</p>

<p>At another corner of the table, over a dish of
cutlets with peas, and a bottle of sour Crimean
wine called &#8220;Bordeaux,&#8221; sit two infantry officers;
one with a red collar, who is young and has two
stars on his coat, is telling the other, with a black
collar and no stars, about the affair at Alma. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
former has already drunk a good deal, and it is
evident, from the breaks in his narrative, from his
undecided glance expressive of doubt as to whether
he is believed, and chiefly from the altogether too
prominent part which he has played in it all, and
from the excessive horror of it all, that he is
strongly disinclined to bear strict witness to the
truth. But these tales, which you will hear for a
long time to come in every corner of Russia, are
nothing to you; you prefer to go to the bastions,
especially to the fourth, of which you have heard
so many and such diverse things. When any one
says that he has been in the fourth bastion, he
says it with a peculiar air of pride and satisfaction;
when any one says, &#8220;I am going to the fourth bastion,&#8221;
either a little agitation or a very great indifference
is infallibly perceptible in him; when
any one wants to jest about another, he says,
&#8220;You must be stationed in the fourth bastion;&#8221;
when you meet litters and inquire whence they
come, the answer is generally, &#8220;From the fourth
bastion.&#8221; On the whole, two totally different
opinions exist with regard to this terrible bastion;
one is held by those who have never been in it,
and who are convinced that the fourth bastion is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
regular grave for every one who enters it, and the
other by those who live in it, like the white-lashed
midshipman, and who, when they mention the
fourth bastion, will tell you whether it is dry or
muddy there, whether it is warm or cold in the
mud hut, and so forth.</p>

<p>During the half-hour which you have passed in
the inn, the weather has changed; a fog which
before spread over the sea has collected into
damp, heavy, gray clouds, and has veiled the sun;
a kind of melancholy, frozen mist sprinkles from
above, and wets the roofs, the sidewalks, and the
soldiers' overcoats.</p>

<p>Passing by yet another barricade, you emerge
from the door at the right and ascend the principal
street. Behind this barricade, the houses are unoccupied
on both sides of the street, there are no
signs, the doors are covered with boards, the windows
are broken in; here the corners are broken
away, there the roofs are pierced. The buildings
seem to be old, to have undergone every sort of
vicissitude and deprivation characteristic of veterans,
and appear to gaze proudly and somewhat
scornfully upon you. You stumble over the cannon-balls
which strew the way, and into holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
filled with water, which have been excavated in
the stony ground by the bombs. In the street
you meet and overtake bodies of soldiers, sharpshooters,
officers; now and then you encounter a
woman or a child, but it is no longer a woman in
a bonnet, but a sailor's daughter in an old fur
cloak and soldier's boots. As you proceed along
the street, and descend a small declivity, you
observe that there are no longer any houses about
you, but only some strange heaps of ruined stones,
boards, clay, and beams; ahead of you, upon a
steep hill, you perceive a black, muddy expanse,
intersected by canals, and this that is in front is
the fourth bastion. Here you meet still fewer
people, no women are visible, the soldiers walk
briskly, you come across drops of blood on the
road, and you will certainly encounter there four
soldiers with a stretcher and upon the stretcher a
pale yellowish face and a blood-stained overcoat.
If you inquire, &#8220;Where is he wounded?&#8221; the
bearers will say angrily, without turning towards
you, &#8220;In the leg or the arm,&#8221; if he is slightly
wounded, or they will preserve a gloomy silence
if no head is visible on the stretcher and he is already
dead or badly hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The shriek of a cannon-ball or a bomb close by
surprises you unpleasantly, as you ascend the hill.
You understand all at once, and quite differently
from what you have before, the significance of
those sounds of shots which you heard in the
city. A quietly cheerful memory flashes suddenly
before your fancy; your own personality
begins to occupy you more than your observations;
your attention to all that surrounds you
diminishes, and a certain disagreeable feeling of
uncertainty suddenly overmasters you. In spite
of this decidedly base voice, which suddenly
speaks within you, at the sight of danger, you
force it to be silent, especially when you glance
at a soldier who runs laughing past you at a trot,
waving his hands, and slipping down the hill in
the mud, and you involuntarily expand your
chest, throw up your head a little higher, and
climb the slippery, clayey hill. As soon as
you have reached the top, rifle-balls begin to
whiz to the right and left of you, and, possibly,
you begin to reflect whether you will not go into
the trench which runs parallel with the road; but
this trench is full of such yellow, liquid, foul-smelling
mud, more than knee-deep, that you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
infallibly choose the path on the hill, the more so
as you see that <i>every one uses the path</i>. After
traversing a couple of hundred paces, you emerge
upon a muddy expanse, all ploughed up, and surrounded
on all sides by gabions, earthworks, platforms,
earth huts, upon which great cast-iron
guns stand, and cannon-balls lie in symmetrical
heaps. All these seem to be heaped up without
any aim, connection, or order. Here in the
battery sit a knot of sailors; there in the middle
of the square, half buried in mud, lies a broken
cannon; further on, a foot-soldier, with his gun, is
marching through the battery, and dragging his
feet with difficulty through the sticky soil. But
everywhere, on all sides, in every spot, you see
broken dishes, unexploded bombs, cannon-balls,
signs of encampment, all sunk in the liquid, viscous
mud. You seem to hear not far from you the
thud of a cannon-ball; on all sides, you seem to
hear the varied sounds of balls,&#8212;humming like
bees, whistling sharply, or in a whine like a cord&#8212;you
hear the frightful roar of the fusillade,
which seems to shake you all through with some
horrible fright.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;So this is it, the fourth bastion, this is it&#8212;that
terrible, really frightful place!&#8221; you think to
yourself, and you experience a little sensation of
pride, and a very large sensation of suppressed
terror. But you are mistaken, this is not the
fourth bastion. It is the Yazonovsky redoubt&#8212;a
place which is comparatively safe; and not at all
dreadful.</p>

<p>In order to reach the fourth bastion, you
turn to the right, through this narrow trench,
through which the foot-soldier has gone. In this
trench you will perhaps meet stretchers again,
sailors and soldiers with shovels; you will see the
superintendent of the mines, mud huts, into
which only two men can crawl by bending down,
and there you will see sharpshooters of the Black
Sea battalions, who are changing their shoes,
eating, smoking their pipes, and living; and
you will still see everywhere that same stinking
mud, traces of a camp, and cast-off iron débris in
every possible form. Proceeding yet three hundred
paces, you will emerge again upon a battery,&#8212;on
an open space, all cut up into holes and surrounded
by gabions, covered with earth, cannon,
and earthworks. Here you will perhaps see five
sailors playing cards under the shelter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
breastworks, and a naval officer who, perceiving
that you are a new-comer, and curious, will with
pleasure show his household arrangements, and
everything which may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>This officer rolls himself a cigarette of yellow
paper, with so much composure as he sits on a
gun, walks so calmly from one embrasure to another,
converses with you so quietly, without the
slightest affectation, that, in spite of the bullets
which hum above you even more thickly than
before, you become cool yourself, question attentively,
and listen to the officer's replies.</p>

<p>This officer will tell you, but only if you ask him,
about the bombardment on the 5th, he will tell
you how only one gun in his battery could be
used, and out of all the gunners who served it
only eight remained, and how, nevertheless, on
the next morning, the 6th, he fired all the guns;
he will tell you how a bomb fell upon a sailor's
earth hut on the 5th, and laid low eleven men;
he will point out to you, from the embrasures,
the enemy's batteries and entrenchments, which
are not more than thirty or forty fathoms distant
from this point. I fear, however, that, under
the influence of the whizzing bullets, you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
thrust yourself out of the embrasure in order to
view the enemy; you will see nothing, and, if you
do see anything, you will be very much surprised
that that white stone wall, which is so near you
and from which white smoke rises in puffs,&#8212;that
that white wall is the enemy&#8212;<i>he</i>, as the soldiers
and sailors say.</p>

<p>It is even quite possible that the naval officer
will want to discharge a shot or two in
your presence, out of vanity or simply for his
own pleasure. &#8220;Send the captain and his crew
to the cannon;&#8221; and fourteen sailors step up
briskly and merrily to the gun and load it&#8212;one
thrusting his pipe into his pocket, another
one chewing a biscuit, still another clattering his
heels on the platform.</p>

<p>Observe the faces, the bearing, the movements
of these men. In every wrinkle of that sunburned
face, with its high cheek-bones, in every muscle, in
the breadth of those shoulders, in the stoutness of
those legs shod in huge boots, in every calm, firm,
deliberate gesture, these chief traits which constitute
the power of Russia&#8212;simplicity and straightforwardness&#8212;are
visible; but here, on every face,
it seems to you that the danger, misery, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
sufferings of war have, in addition to these principal
characteristics, left traces of consciousness of
personal worth, emotion, and exalted thought.</p>

<p>All at once a frightful roar, which shakes not
your organs of hearing alone but your whole
being, startles you so that you tremble all over.
Then you hear the distant shriek of the shot
as it pursues its course, and the dense smoke of
the powder conceals from you the platform and
the black figures of the sailors who are moving
about upon it. You hear various remarks of the
sailors in reference to this shot, and you see their
animation, and an exhibition of a feeling which
you had not expected to behold perhaps&#8212;a
feeling of malice, of revenge against the enemy,
which lies hidden in the soul of each man. &#8220;It
struck the embrasure itself; it seems to have
killed two men&#8212;see, they've carried them off!&#8221;
you hear in joyful exclamation. &#8220;And now they
are angry; they'll fire at us directly,&#8221; says some
one; and, in fact, shortly after you see a flash in
front and smoke; the sentry, who is standing on
the breastwork, shouts &#8220;Can-non!&#8221; And then
the ball shrieks past you, strikes the earth, and
scatters a shower of dirt and stones about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>This ball enrages the commander of the battery;
he orders a second and a third gun to be loaded,
the enemy also begins to reply to us, and you
experience a sensation of interest, you hear and
see interesting things. Again the sentry shouts,
&#8220;Can-non!&#8221; and you hear the same report and
blow, the same shower, or he shouts &#8220;Mortar!&#8221;
and you hear the monotonous, even rather pleasant
whistle of the bomb, with which it is difficult to
connect the thought of horror; you hear this whistle
approaching you, and increasing in swiftness,
then you see the black sphere, the impact on the
ground, the resounding explosion of the bomb
which can be felt. With the whistle and shriek,
splinters fly again, stones whiz through the air,
and mud showers over you. At these sounds you
experience a strange feeling of enjoyment, and, at
the same time, of terror. At the moment when
you know that the projectile is flying towards you,
it will infallibly occur to you that this shot will
kill you; but the feeling of self-love upholds you,
and no one perceives the knife which is cutting
your heart. But when the shot has flown past
without touching you, you grow animated, and a
certain cheerful, inexpressibly pleasant feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
overpowers you, but only for a moment, so that
you discover a peculiar sort of charm in danger,
in this game of life and death, you want cannon-balls
or bombs to strike nearer to you.</p>

<p>But again the sentry has shouted in his loud,
thick voice, &#8220;Mortar!&#8221; again there is a shriek,
and a bomb bursts, but with this noise comes the
groan of a man. You approach the wounded man,
at the same moment with the bearers; he has a
strange, inhuman aspect, covered as he is with
blood and mud. A part of the sailor's breast has
been torn away. During the first moments, there
is visible on his mud-stained face only fear and a
certain simulated, premature expression of suffering,
peculiar to men in that condition; but, at the
same time, as the stretcher is brought to him and
he is laid upon it on his sound side, you observe
that this expression is replaced by an expression
of a sort of exaltation and lofty, inexpressible
thought. His eyes shine more brilliantly, his
teeth are clenched, his head is held higher with
difficulty, and, as they lift him up, he stops the
bearers and says to his comrades, with difficulty
and in a trembling voice: &#8220;Farewell, brothers!&#8221;
He tries to say something more, and it is plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that he wants to say something touching, but he
repeats once more: &#8220;Farewell, brothers!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, one of his fellow-sailors steps
up to him, puts the cap on the head which the
wounded man holds towards him, and, waving
his hand indifferently, returns calmly to his gun.
&#8220;That's the way with seven or eight men every
day,&#8221; says the naval officer to you, in reply to the
expression of horror which has appeared upon
your countenance, as he yawns and rolls a cigarette
of yellow paper.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus you have seen the defenders of Sevastopol,
on the very scene of the defence, and you go back
paying no attention, for some reason or other, to
the cannon-balls and bullets, which continue to
shriek the whole way until you reach the ruined
theatre,&#8212;you proceed with composure, and with
your soul in a state of exaltation.</p>

<p>The principal and cheering conviction which
you have brought away is the conviction of the
impossibility of the Russian people wavering anywhere
whatever&#8212;and this impossibility you have
discerned not in the multitude of traverses, breastworks,
artfully interlaced trenches, mines, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
ordnance, piled one upon the other, of which
you have comprehended nothing; but you have
discerned it in the eyes, the speech, the manners,
in what is called the spirit of the defenders
of Sevastopol. What they are doing they
do so simply, with so little effort and exertion,
that you are convinced that they can do a
hundred times more&#8212;that they can do anything.
You understand that the feeling which
makes them work is not a feeling of pettiness,
ambition, forgetfulness, which you have yourself
experienced, but a different sentiment, one more
powerful, and one which has made of them men
who live with their ordinary composure under
the fire of cannon, amid hundreds of chances of
death, instead of the one to which all men are
subject who live under these conditions amid incessant
labor, poverty, and dirt. Men will not accept
these frightful conditions for the sake of a
cross or a title, nor because of threats; there
must be another lofty incentive as a cause, and
this cause is the feeling which rarely appears, of
which a Russian is ashamed, that which lies at the
bottom of each man's soul&#8212;love for his country.</p>

<p>Only now have the tales of the early days of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
siege of Sevastopol, when there were no fortifications
there, no army, no physical possibility of
holding it, and when at the same time there was
not the slightest doubt that it would not surrender
to the enemy,&#8212;of the days when that hero
worthy of ancient Greece, Korniloff, said, as he
reviewed the army: &#8220;We will die, children, but
we will not surrender Sevastopol;&#8221; and our Russians,
who are not fitted to be phrase-makers, replied:
&#8220;We will die! hurrah!&#8221;&#8212;only now have
tales of that time ceased to be for you the most
beautiful historical legends, and have become
real facts and worthy of belief. You comprehend
clearly, you figure to yourself, those men whom
you have just seen, as the very heroes of those
grievous times, who have not fallen, but have
been raised by the spirit, and have joyfully prepared
for death, not for the sake of the city, but
of the country. This epos of Sevastopol, whose
hero was the Russian people, will leave mighty
traces in Russia for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Night is already falling. The sun has emerged
from the gray clouds, which cover the sky just
before its setting, and has suddenly illuminated
with a crimson glow the purple vapors, the greenish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
sea covered with ships and boats rocking on
the regular swell, and the white buildings of the
city, and the people who are moving through its
streets. Sounds of some old waltz played by the
regimental band on the boulevard, and the sounds
of firing from the bastions, which echo them
strangely, are borne across the water.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Six months have already passed since the first
cannon-ball whistled from the bastions of Sevastopol,
and ploughed the earth in the works of the
enemy, and since that day thousands of bombs,
cannon-balls, and rifle-balls have been flying incessantly
from the bastions into the trenches and
from the trenches into the bastions, and the angel
of death has never ceased to hover over them.</p>

<p>Thousands of men have been disappointed in
satisfying their ambition; thousands have succeeded
in satisfying theirs, in becoming swollen
with pride; thousands repose in the embrace of
death. How many red coffins and canvas canopies
there have been! And still the same sounds
are echoed from the bastions, and still on clear
evenings the French peer from their camp,
with involuntary tremor, at the yellow, furrowed
bastions of Sevastopol, at the black forms of
our sailors moving about upon them, and count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the embrasures and the iron cannon which project
angrily from them; the under officer still
gazes through his telescope, from the heights
of the telegraph station, at the dark figures of
the French at their batteries, at their tents, at
the columns moving over the green hill, and at
the puffs of smoke which issue forth from the
trenches,&#8212;and a crowd of men, formed of divers
races, still streams in throngs from various quarters,
with the same ardor as ever, and with desires
differing even more greatly than their races,
towards this fateful spot. And the question,
unsolved by the diplomats, has still not been
solved by powder and blood.</p>

<p>On the boulevard of the besieged city of Sevastopol,
not far from the pavilion, the regimental
band was playing, and throngs of military men
and of women moved gayly through the streets.
The brilliant sun of spring had risen in the morning
over the works of the English, had passed
over the bastions, then over the city, over the
Nikolaevsky barracks, and, illuminating all with
equal cheer, had now sunk into the blue and distant
sea, which was lighted with a silvery gleam
as it heaved in peace.</p>

<p>A tall, rather bent infantry officer, who was
drawing upon his hand a glove which was presentable,
if not entirely white, came out of one of the
small naval huts, built on the left side of the
Morskaya<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> street, and, staring thoughtfully at
the ground, took his way up the slope to the
boulevard.</p>

<p>The expression of this officer's homely countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
did not indicate any great mental capacity,
but rather simplicity, judgment, honor, and a tendency
to solid worth. He was badly built, not
graceful, and he seemed to be constrained in his
movements. He was dressed in a little worn cap,
a cloak of a rather peculiar shade of lilac, from
beneath whose edge the gold of a watch-chain was
visible; in trousers with straps, and brilliantly
polished calfskin boots. He must have been
either a German&#8212;but his features clearly indicate
his purely Russian descent&#8212;or an adjutant,
or a regimental quartermaster, only in that case
he would have had spurs, or an officer who had
exchanged from the cavalry for the period of the
campaign, or possibly from the Guards. He was,
in fact, an officer who had exchanged from the
cavalry, and as he ascended the boulevard, at the
present moment, he was meditating upon a letter
which he had just received from a former comrade,
now a retired land-owner in the Government
of T., and his wife, pale, blue-eyed Natasha, his
great friend. He recalled one passage of the letter,
in which his comrade said:&#8212;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;When our <i>Invalid</i><a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> arrives, Pupka (this was
the name by which the retired uhlan called his
wife) rushes headlong into the vestibule, seizes the
paper, and runs with it to the seat in the arbor,
<i>in the drawing-room</i> (in which, if you remember,
you and I passed such delightful winter evenings
when the regiment was stationed in our town),
and reads your heroic deeds with such ardor as
it is impossible for you to imagine. She often
speaks of you. &#8216;There is Mikhaïloff,&#8217; she says,
&#8216;he's such a <i>love of a man</i>. I am ready to kiss
him when I see him. He fights on the bastions,
and he will surely receive the Cross of St. George,
and he will be talked about in the newspapers
...&#8217; and so on, and so on ... so that I am
really beginning to be jealous of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another place he writes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> &#8220;The papers reach
us frightfully late, and, although there is plenty of
news conveyed by word of mouth, not all of it can
be trusted. For instance, the <i>young ladies with the
music</i>, acquaintances of yours, were saying yesterday
that Napoleon was already captured by our
Cossacks, and that he had been sent to Petersburg;
but you will comprehend how much I believe
of this. Moreover, a traveller from Petersburg
told us (he has been sent on special business
by the minister, is a very agreeable person, and,
now that there is no one in town, he is more of a
<i>resource</i> to us than you can well imagine ...)
well, he declares it to be a fact that our troops
have taken Eupatoria, <i>so that the French have no
communication whatever with Balaklava</i>, and that
in this engagement two hundred of ours were
killed, but that the French lost fifteen thousand.
My wife was in such raptures over this that she
<i>caroused</i> all night, and she declares that her instinct
tells her that you certainly took part in that
affair, and that you distinguished yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of these words, and of the expressions
which I have purposely put in italics, and the
whole tone of the letter, Staff-Captain Mikhaïloff
recalled, with inexpressibly sad delight, his pale
friend in the provinces, and how she had sat with
him in the arbor in the evening, and talked about
sentiment, and he thought of his good comrade, the
uhlan, and of how the latter had grown angry and
had lost the game when they had played cards for
kopek stakes in his study, and how the wife had
laughed at them ... he recalled the friendship of
these two people for himself (perhaps it seemed to
him to lie chiefly on the side of his pale feminine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
friend); all these faces with their surroundings
flitted before his mind's eye, in a wonderfully sweet,
cheerfully rosy light, and, smiling at his reminiscences,
he placed his hand on the pocket which
contained the letter so dear to him.</p>

<p>From reminiscences Captain Mikhaïloff involuntarily
proceeded to dreams and hopes. &#8220;And
what will be the joy and amazement of Natasha,&#8221;
he thought, as he paced along the narrow lane,
&#8220;... when she suddenly reads in the <i>Invalid</i>
a description of how I was the first to climb upon
the cannon, and that I have received the George!
I shall certainly be promoted to a full captaincy,
by virtue of seniority. Then it is quite possible
that I may get the grade of major in the line, this
very year, because many of our brothers have
already been killed, and many more will be in this
campaign. And after that there will be more
affairs on hand, and a regiment will be entrusted
to me, since I am an experienced man ... lieutenant-colonel
... the Order of St. Anna on my
neck ... colonel!...&#8221; and he was already a
general, granting an interview to Natasha, the
widow of his comrade, who, according to his
dreams, would have died by that time, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
sounds of the music on the boulevard penetrated
more distinctly to his ears, the crowds of people
caught his eye, and he found himself on the boulevard,
a staff-captain of infantry as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>He went, first of all, to the pavilion, near which
were standing the musicians, for whom other
soldiers of the same regiment were holding the
notes, in the absence of stands, and about whom
a ring of cadets, nurses, and children had formed,
intent rather on seeing than on hearing. Around
the pavilion stood, sat, or walked sailors, adjutants,
and officers in white gloves. Along the
grand avenue of the boulevard paced officers of
every sort, and women of every description, rarely
in bonnets, mostly with kerchiefs on their heads
(some had neither bonnets nor kerchiefs), but no
one was old, and it was worthy of note that all
were gay young creatures. Beyond, in the shady
and fragrant alleys of white acacia, isolated groups
walked and sat.</p>

<p>No one was especially delighted to encounter
Captain Mikhaïloff on the boulevard, with the
exception, possibly, of the captain of his regiment,
Obzhogoff, and Captain Suslikoff, who pressed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
hand warmly; but the former was dressed in
camel's-hair trousers, no gloves, a threadbare
coat, and his face was very red and covered with
perspiration, and the second shouted so loudly and
incoherently that it was mortifying to walk with
them, particularly in the presence of the officers
in white gloves (with one of whom, an adjutant,
Staff-Captain Mikhaïloff exchanged bows; and he
might have bowed to another staff-officer, since he
had met him twice at the house of a mutual acquaintance).
Besides, what pleasure was it to
him to promenade with these two gentlemen,
Obzhogoff and Suslikoff, when he had met them
and shaken hands with them six times that day
already? It was not for this that he had come.</p>

<p>He wanted to approach the adjutant with whom
he had exchanged bows, and to enter into conversation
with these officers, not for the sake of letting
Captains Obzhogoff and Suslikoff and Lieutenant
Pashtetzky see him talking with them, but
simply because they were agreeable people, and,
what was more, they knew the news, and would
have told it.</p>

<p>But why is Captain Mikhaïloff afraid, and why
cannot he make up his mind to approach them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
&#8220;What if they should, all at once, refuse to recognize
me,&#8221; he thinks, &#8220;or, having bowed to me,
what if they continue their conversation among
themselves, as though I did not exist, or walk
away from me entirely, and leave me standing
there alone among the <i>aristocrats</i>.&#8221; The word
aristocrats (in the sense of a higher, select circle,
in any rank of life) has acquired for some time
past with us, in Russia, a great popularity, and
has penetrated into every locality and into every
class of society whither vanity has penetrated&#8212;among
merchants, among officials, writers, and
officers, to Saratoff, to Mamaduish, to Vinnitz,
everywhere where men exist.</p>

<p>To Captain Obzhogoff, Staff-Captain Mikhaïloff
was an <i>aristocrat</i>. To Staff-Captain Mikhaïloff,
Adjutant Kalugin was an <i>aristocrat</i>, because he
was an adjutant, and was on such a footing with
the other adjutants as to call them &#8220;thou&#8221;! To
Adjutant Kalugin, Count Nordoff was an <i>aristocrat</i>,
because he was an adjutant on the Emperor's
staff.</p>

<p>Vanity! vanity! and vanity everywhere, even on
the brink of the grave, and among men ready to
die for the highest convictions. Vanity! It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
be that it is a characteristic trait, and a peculiar
malady of our century. Why was nothing ever
heard among the men of former days, of this passion,
any more than of the small-pox or the
cholera? Why did Homer and Shakespeare talk
of love, of glory, of suffering, while the literature
of our age is nothing but an endless narrative of
snobs and vanity?</p>

<p>The staff-captain walked twice in indecision
past the group of <i>his aristocrats</i>, and the third
time he exerted an effort over himself and went
up to them. This group consisted of four officers:
Adjutant Kalugin, an acquaintance of Mikhaïloff's,
Adjutant Prince Galtsin, who was something of
an aristocrat even for Kalugin himself, Colonel
Neferdoff, one of the so-called <i>hundred and twenty-two</i>
men of the world (who had entered the service
for this campaign, from the retired list), and
Captain of Cavalry Praskukhin, also one of the
hundred and twenty-two. Luckily for Mikhaïloff,
Kalugin was in a very fine humor (the general
had just been talking to him in a very confidential
way, and Prince Galtsin, who had just arrived
from Petersburg, was stopping with him); he did
not consider it beneath his dignity to give his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
hand to Captain Mikhaïloff, which Praskukhin,
however, could not make up his mind to do,
though he had met Mikhaïloff very frequently
on the bastion, had drunk the latter's wine and
vodka, and was even indebted to him twenty
rubles and a half at preference. As he did not
yet know Prince Galtsin very well, he did not wish
to convict himself, in the latter's presence, of an
acquaintance with a simple staff-captain of infantry.
He bowed slightly to the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Captain,&#8221; said Kalugin, &#8220;when are we
to go to the bastion again? Do you remember
how we met each other on the Schvartz redoubt&#8212;it
was hot there, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was hot,&#8221; said Mikhaïloff, recalling how
he had, that night, as he was making his way
along the trenches to the bastion, encountered
Kalugin, who was walking along like a hero,
valiantly clanking his sword. &#8220;I ought to have
gone there to-morrow, according to present arrangements;
but we have a sick man,&#8221; pursued
Mikhaïloff, &#8220;one officer, as....&#8221;</p>

<p>He was about to relate how it was not his turn,
but, as the commander of the eighth company was
ill, and the company had only a cornet left, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
regarded it as his duty to offer himself in the
place of Lieutenant Nepshisetzky, and was, therefore,
going to the bastion to-day. But Kalugin
did not hear him out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a feeling that something is going to
happen within a few days,&#8221; he said to Prince
Galtsin.</p>

<p>&#8220;And won't there be something to-day?&#8221; asked
Mikhaïloff, glancing first at Kalugin, then at
Galtsin.</p>

<p>No one made him any reply. Prince Galtsin
merely frowned a little, sent his eyes past the
other's cap, and, after maintaining silence for a
moment, said:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's a magnificent girl in the red kerchief.
You don't know her, do you, captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She lives near my quarters; she is the daughter
of a sailor,&#8221; replied the staff-captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on; let's have a good look at her.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Prince Galtsin linked one arm in that of
Kalugin, the other in that of the staff-captain,
being convinced in advance that he could afford
the latter no greater gratification, which was, in
fact, quite true.</p>

<p>The staff-captain was superstitious, and considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
it a great sin to occupy himself with women
before a battle; but on this occasion he feigned
to be a vicious man, which Prince Galtsin and
Kalugin evidently did not believe, and which
greatly amazed the girl in the red kerchief, who
had more than once observed how the staff-captain
blushed as he passed her little window. Praskukhin
walked behind, and kept touching Prince
Galtsin with his hand, and making various remarks
in the French tongue; but as a fourth person
could not walk on the small path, he was obliged
to walk alone, and it was only on the second round
that he took the arm of the brave and well known
naval officer <i>Servyagin</i>, who had stepped up and
spoken to him, and who was also desirous of joining
the circle of <i>aristocrats</i>. And the gallant and
famous beau joyfully thrust his honest and muscular
hand through the elbow of a man who was
known to all, and even well known to Servyagin, as
not too nice. When Praskukhin, explaining to the
prince his acquaintance with <i>that sailor</i>, whispered
to him that the latter was well known for his
bravery, Prince Galtsin, having been on the fourth
bastion on the previous evening, having seen a
bomb burst twenty paces from him, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
himself no less a hero than this gentleman, and
thinking that many a reputation is acquired undeservedly,
paid no particular attention to Servyagin.</p>

<p>It was so agreeable to Staff-Captain Mikhaïloff
to walk about in this company that he forgot the
<i>dear</i> letter from T&#8212;&#8212;, and the gloomy thoughts
which had assailed him in connection with his
impending departure for the bastion. He remained
with them until they began to talk exclusively
among themselves, avoiding his glances,
thereby giving him to understand that he might
go, and finally deserted him entirely. But the
staff-captain was content, nevertheless, and as he
passed Yunker<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> Baron Pesth, who had been particularly
haughty and self-conceited since the
preceding night, which was the first that he had
spent in the bomb-proof of the fifth bastion, and
consequently considered himself a hero, he was
not in the least offended at the presumptuous
expression with which the yunker straightened
himself up and doffed his hat before him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>When later the staff-captain crossed the threshold
of his quarters, entirely different thoughts
entered his mind. He looked around his little
chamber, with its uneven earth floor, and saw
the windows all awry, pasted over with paper,
his old bed, with a rug nailed over it, upon which
was depicted a lady on horseback, and over which
hung two Tula pistols, the dirty couch of a cadet
who lived with him, and which was covered with
a chintz coverlet; he saw his Nikita, who, with
untidy, tallowed hair, rose from the floor, scratching
his head; he saw his ancient cloak, his
extra pair of boots, and a little bundle, from
which peeped a bit of cheese and the neck of
a porter bottle filled with vodka, which had been
prepared for his use on the bastion, and all at
once he remembered that he was obliged to go
with his company that night to the fortifications.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is certainly foreordained that I am to be
killed to-night,&#8221; thought the captain....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> &#8220;I feel
it. And the principal point is that I need not
have gone, but that I offered myself. And the
man who thrusts himself forward is always killed.
And what's the matter with that accursed
Nepshisetsky? It is quite possible that he is not
sick at all; and they will kill another man for his
sake, they will infallibly kill him. However, if
they don't kill me, I shall be promoted probably.
I saw how delighted the regimental commander
was when I asked him to allow me to go, if
Lieutenant Nepshisetsky was ill. If I don't turn
out a major, then I shall certainly get the Vladímir
cross. This is the thirteenth time that I have
been to the bastion. Ah, the thirteenth is an unlucky
number. They will surely kill me, I feel
that I shall be killed; but some one had to go, it
was impossible for the lieutenant of the corps to
go. And, whatever happens, the honor of the
regiment, the honor of the army, depends on it.
It was my <i>duty</i> to go ... yes, my sacred duty.
But I have a foreboding.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain forgot that this was not the first
time that a similar foreboding had assailed him,
in a greater or less degree, when it had been
necessary to go to the bastion, and he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
know that every one who sets out on an affair
experiences this foreboding with more or less
force. Having calmed himself with this conception
of duty, which was especially and strongly
developed in the staff-captain, he seated himself
at the table, and began to write a farewell
letter to his father. Ten minutes later, having
finished his letter, he rose from the table, his
eyes wet with tears, and, mentally reciting all
the prayers he knew, he set about dressing. His
coarse, drunken servant indolently handed him his
new coat (the old one, which the captain generally
wore when going to the bastion, was not mended).</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is not my coat mended? You never do
anything but sleep, you good-for-nothing!&#8221; said
Mikhaïloff, angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep!&#8221; grumbled Nikita. &#8220;You run like a
dog all day long; perhaps you stop&#8212;but you
must not sleep, even then!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are drunk again, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't get drunk on your money, so you
needn't scold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue, blockhead!&#8221; shouted the
captain, who was ready to strike the man. He
had been absent-minded at first, but now he was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
at last, out of patience, and embittered by the
rudeness of Nikita, whom he loved, even spoiled,
and who had lived with him for twelve years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blockhead? Blockhead?&#8221; repeated the servant.
&#8220;Why do you call me a blockhead, sir?
Is this a time for that sort of thing? It is not
good to curse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mikhaïloff recalled whither he was on the point
of going, and felt ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are enough to put a saint out of patience,
Nikita,&#8221; he said, in a gentle voice. &#8220;Leave that
letter to my father on the table, and don't touch
it,&#8221; he added, turning red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Nikita, melting under the
influence of the wine which he had drunk, as he
had said, &#8220;at his own expense,&#8221; and winking his
eyes with a visible desire to weep.</p>

<p>But when the captain said: &#8220;Good-by, Nikita,&#8221;
on the porch, Nikita suddenly broke down into
repressed sobs, and ran to kiss his master's
hand.... &#8220;Farewell, master!&#8221; he exclaimed,
sobbing. The old sailor's wife, who was standing
on the porch, could not, in her capacity of a
woman, refrain from joining in this touching
scene, so she began to wipe her eyes with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
dirty sleeve, and to say something about even
gentlemen having their trials to bear, and that
she, poor creature, had been left a widow. And
she related for the hundredth time to drunken
Nikita the story of her woes; how her husband
had been killed in the first bombardment, and
how her little house had been utterly ruined (the
one in which she was now living did not belong
to her), and so on. When his master had departed,
Nikita lighted his pipe, requested the
daughter of their landlord to go for some vodka,
and very soon ceased to weep, but, on the contrary,
got into a quarrel with the old woman about
some small bucket, which, he declared, she had
broken.</p>

<p>&#8220;But perhaps I shall only be wounded,&#8221; meditated
the captain, as he marched through the
twilight to the bastion with his company. &#8220;But
where? How? Here or here?&#8221; he thought,
indicating his belly and his breast.... &#8220;If it
should be here (he thought of the upper portion
of his leg), it might run round. Well, but if it
were here, and by a splinter, that would finish
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain reached the fortifications safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
through the trenches, set his men to work, with
the assistance of an officer of sappers, in the darkness,
which was complete, and seated himself in
a pit behind the breastworks. There was not
much firing; only once in a while the lightning
flashed from our batteries, then from <i>his</i>, and the
brilliant fuse of a bomb traced an arc of flame
against the dark, starry heavens. But all the
bombs fell far in the rear and to the right of the
rifle-pits in which the captain sat. He drank his
vodka, ate his cheese, lit his cigarette, and, after
saying his prayers, he tried to get a little sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Prince Galtsin, Lieutenant-Colonel Neferdoff,
and Praskukhin, whom no one had invited, to
whom no one spoke, but who never left them, all
went to drink tea with Adjutant Kalugin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you did not finish telling me about
Vaska Mendel,&#8221; said Kalugin, as he took off his
cloak, seated himself by the window in a soft
lounging-chair, and unbuttoned the collar of his
fresh, stiffly starched cambric shirt: &#8220;How did
he come to marry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's a joke, my dear fellow! There was a
time, I assure you, when nothing else was talked
of in Petersburg,&#8221; said Prince Galtsin, with a
laugh, as he sprang up from the piano, and seated
himself on the window beside Kalugin. &#8220;It is
simply ludicrous, and I know all the details of the
affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he began to relate&#8212;in a merry, and
skilful manner&#8212;a love story, which we will omit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
because it possesses no interest for us. But it is
worthy of note that not only Prince Galtsin, but
all the gentlemen who had placed themselves
here, one on the window-sill, another with his legs
coiled up under him, a third at the piano, seemed
totally different persons from what they were
when on the boulevard; there was nothing of that
absurd arrogance and haughtiness which they and
their kind exhibit in public to the infantry officers;
here they were among their own set and
natural, especially Kalugin and Prince Galtsin,
and were like very good, amiable, and merry children.
The conversation turned on their companions
in the service in Petersburg, and on their
acquaintances.</p>

<p>&#8220;What of Maslovsky?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which? the uhlan of the body-guard or of
the horse-guard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know both of them. The one in the horse-guards
was with me when he was a little boy, and
had only just left school. What is the elder one?
a captain of cavalry?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is he still going about with his gypsy
maid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he has deserted her ...&#8221; and so forth,
and so forth, in the same strain.</p>

<p>Then Prince Galtsin seated himself at the
piano, and sang a gypsy song in magnificent style.
Praskukhin began to sing second, although no
one had asked him, and he did it so well that they
requested him to accompany the prince again,
which he gladly consented to do.</p>

<p>The servant came in with the tea, cream, and
cracknels on a silver salver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Serve the prince,&#8221; said Kalugin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, it is strange to think,&#8221; said Galtsin,
taking a glass, and walking to the window, &#8220;that
we are in a beleaguered city; tea with cream, and
such quarters as I should be only too happy to
get in Petersburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if it were not for that,&#8221; said the old
lieutenant-colonel, who was dissatisfied with
everything, &#8220;this constant waiting for something
would be simply unendurable ... and to
see how men are killed, killed every day,&#8212;and
there is no end to it, and under such circumstances
it would not be comfortable to live in
the mud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how about our infantry officers?&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Kalugin. &#8220;They live in the bastions with the
soldiers in the casemates and eat beet soup with
the soldiers&#8212;how about them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about them? They don't change their
linen for ten days at a time, and they are heroes&#8212;wonderful
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment an officer of infantry entered
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ... I was ordered ... may I present myself
to the gen ... to His Excellency from General
N.?&#8221; he inquired, bowing with an air of
embarrassment.</p>

<p>Kalugin rose, but, without returning the officer's
salute, he asked him, with insulting courtesy
and strained official smile, whether <i>they</i><a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> would
not wait awhile; and, without inviting him to be
seated or paying any further attention to him, he
turned to Prince Galtsin and began to speak to
him in French, so that the unhappy officer, who
remained standing in the middle of the room,
absolutely did not know what to do with himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is on very important business, sir,&#8221; said the
officer, after a momentary pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! very well, then,&#8221; said Kalugin, putting
on his cloak, and accompanying him to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Eh bien, messieurs</i>, I think there will be hot
work to-night,&#8221; said Kalugin in French, on his
return from the general's.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey? What? A sortie?&#8221; They all began
to question him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know yet&#8212;you will see for yourselves,&#8221;
replied Kalugin, with a mysterious smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;And my commander is on the bastion&#8212;of
course, I shall have to go,&#8221; said Praskukhin, buckling
on his sword.</p>

<p>But no one answered him: he must know for
himself whether he had to go or not.</p>

<p>Praskukhin and Neferdoff went off, in order to
betake themselves to their posts. &#8220;Farewell,
gentlemen!&#8221; &#8220;Au revoir, gentlemen! We shall
meet again to-night!&#8221; shouted Kalugin from the
window when Praskukhin and Neferdoff trotted
down the street, bending over the bows of their
Cossack saddles. The trampling of their Cossack
horses soon died away in the dusky street.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, tell me, is something really going to take
place to-night?&#8221; said Galtsin, in French, as he
leaned with Kalugin on the window-sill, and gazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
at the bombs which were flying over the
bastions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you, you see ... you have been on
the bastions, of course?&#8221; (Galtsin made a sign
of assent, although he had been only once to the
fourth bastion.) &#8220;Well, there was a trench opposite
our lunette&#8221;, and Kalugin, who was not a
specialist, although he considered his judgment
on military affairs particularly accurate, began to
explain the position of our troops and of the
enemy's works and the plan of the proposed affair,
mixing up the technical terms of fortifications a
good deal in the process.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are beginning to hammer away at
our casemates. Oho! was that ours or <i>his</i>? there,
it has burst,&#8221; they said, as they leaned on the
window-sill, gazing at the fiery line of the bomb,
which exploded in the air, at the lightning of the
discharges, at the dark blue sky, momentarily
illuminated, and at the white smoke of the powder,
and listened to the sounds of the firing, which
grew louder and louder.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a charming sight? is it not?&#8221; said
Kalugin, in French, directing the attention of his
guest to the really beautiful spectacle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> &#8220;Do you
know, you cannot distinguish the stars from the
bombs at times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was just thinking that that was a star;
but it darted down ... there, it has burst now.
And that big star yonder, what is it called? It
is just exactly like a bomb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, I have grown so used to these
bombs that I am convinced that a starlight night
in Russia will always seem to me to be all bombs;
one gets so accustomed to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But am not I to go on this sortie?&#8221; inquired
Galtsin, after a momentary silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough of that, brother! Don't think of
such a thing! I won't let you go!&#8221; replied Kalugin.
&#8220;Your turn will come, brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seriously? So you think that it is not necessary
to go? Hey?...&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, a frightful crash of rifles was
heard in the direction in which these gentlemen
were looking, above the roar of the cannon, and
thousands of small fires, flaring up incessantly,
without intermission, flashed along the entire line.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's it, when the real work has begun!&#8221;
said Kalugin.&#8212;&#8220;That is the sound of the rifles,
and I cannot hear it in cold blood; it takes a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of hold on your soul, you know. And there is
the hurrah!&#8221; he added, listening to the prolonged
and distant roar of hundreds of voices, &#8220;A-a-aa!&#8221;
which reached him from the bastion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this hurrah, theirs or ours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know; but it has come to a hand-to-hand
fight, for the firing has ceased.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, an officer followed by his Cossack
galloped up to the porch, and slipped down
from his horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the bastion. The general is wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go. Well, now, what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have attacked the lodgements ... have
taken them ... the French have brought up
their heavy reserves ... they have attacked our
forces ... there were only two battalions,&#8221; said
the panting officer, who was the same that had
come in the evening, drawing his breath with
difficulty, but stepping to the door with perfect
unconcern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, have they retreated?&#8221; inquired Galtsin.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the officer, angrily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> &#8220;The
battalion came up and beat them back; but the
commander of the regiment is killed, and many
officers, and I have been ordered to ask for re-enforcements....&#8221;</p>

<p>And with these words he and Kalugin went off
to the general, whither we will not follow them.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Kalugin was mounted on
the Cossack's horse (and with that peculiar, <i>quasi</i>-Cossack
seat, in which, as I have observed, all
adjutants find something especially captivating,
for some reason or other), and rode at a trot to
the bastion, in order to give some orders, and to
await the news of the final result of the affair.
And Prince Galtsin, under the influence of that
oppressive emotion which the signs of a battle
near at hand usually produce on a spectator who
takes no part in it, went out into the street, and
began to pace up and down there without any
object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The soldiers were bearing the wounded on
stretchers, and supporting them by their arms.
It was completely dark in the streets; now and
then, a rare light flashed in the hospital or from
the spot where the officers were seated. The
same thunder of cannon and exchange of rifle-shots
was borne from the bastions, and the same
fires flashed against the dark heavens. Now and
then, you could hear the trampling hoofs of an
orderly's horse, the groan of a wounded man, the
footsteps and voices of the stretcher-bearers, or
the conversation of some of the frightened female
inhabitants, who had come out on their porches
to view the cannonade.</p>

<p>Among the latter were our acquaintances
Nikita, the old sailor's widow, with whom he
had already made his peace, and her ten-year-old
daughter. &#8220;Lord, Most Holy Mother of God!&#8221;
whispered the old woman to herself with a sigh,
as she watched the bombs, which, like balls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
fire, sailed incessantly from one side to the other.
&#8220;What a shame, what a shame! I-i-hi-hi! It
was not so in the first bombardment. See, there
it has burst, the cursed thing! right above our
house in the suburbs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is farther off, in aunt Arinka's garden,
that they all fall,&#8221; said the little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where, where is my master now!&#8221; said
Nikita, with a drawl, for he was still rather drunk.
&#8220;Oh, how I love that master of mine!&#8212;I don't
know myself!&#8212;I love him so that if, which God
forbid, they should kill him in this sinful fight,
then, if you will believe it, aunty, I don't know
myself what I might do to myself in that case&#8212;by
Heavens, I don't! He is such a master that
words will not do him justice! Would I exchange
him for one of those who play cards?
That is simply&#8212;whew! that's all there is to
say!&#8221; concluded Nikita, pointing at the lighted
window of his master's room, in which, as the
staff-captain was absent, Yunker Zhvadchevsky
had invited his friends to a carouse, on the occasion
of his receiving the cross: Sub-Lieutenant
Ugrovitch and Sub-Lieutenant Nepshisetsky, who
was ill with a cold in the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Those little stars! They dart through the
sky like stars, like stars!&#8221; said the little girl,
breaking the silence which succeeded Nikita's
words. &#8220;There, there! another has dropped!
Why do they do it, mamma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will ruin our little cabin entirely,&#8221; said
the old woman, sighing, and not replying to her
little daughter's question.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when uncle and I went there to-day,
mamma,&#8221; continued the little girl, in a shrill
voice, &#8220;there was such a big cannon-ball lying
in the room, near the cupboard; it had broken
through the wall and into the room ... and it is
so big that you couldn't lift it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those who had husbands and money have
gone away,&#8221; said the old woman, &#8220;and now they
have ruined my last little house. See, see how
they are firing, the wretches. Lord, Lord!&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;And as soon as we came out, a bomb flew at
us, and burst and scattered the earth about, and
a piece of the shell came near striking uncle and
me.&#8221;</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Prince Galtsin met more and more wounded
men, in stretchers and on foot, supporting each
other, and talking loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;When they rushed up, brothers,&#8221; said one tall
soldier, who had two guns on his shoulder, in a
bass voice, &#8220;when they rushed up and shouted,
&#8216;Allah, Allah!&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> they pressed each other on. You
kill one, and another takes his place&#8212;you can do
nothing. You never saw such numbers as there
were of them....&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this point in his story Galtsin interrupted
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come from the bastion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so, Your Honor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what has been going on there? Tell
me.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what has been going on? They attacked
in force, Your Honor; they climbed over
the wall, and that's the end of it. They conquered
completely, Your Honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How conquered? You repulsed them, surely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could we repulse them, when he came
up with his whole force? They killed all our
men, and there was no help given us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier was mistaken, for the trenches
were behind our forces; but this is a peculiar
thing, which any one may observe: a soldier
who has been wounded in an engagement always
thinks that the day has been lost, and that the
encounter has been a frightfully bloody one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, what did they mean by telling me that
you had repulsed them?&#8221; said Galtsin, with irritation.
&#8220;Perhaps the enemy was repulsed after
you left? Is it long since you came away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have this instant come from there, Your
Honor,&#8221; replied the soldier. &#8220;It is hardly possible.
The trenches remained in his hands ... he
won a complete victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and are you not ashamed to have surrendered
the trenches? This is horrible!&#8221; said
Galtsin, angered by such indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, when he was there in force?&#8221; growled
the soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;And, Your Honor,&#8221; said a soldier on a
stretcher, who had just come up with them, &#8220;how
could we help surrendering, when nearly all of us
had been killed? If we had been in force, we
would only have surrendered with our lives. But
what was there to do? I ran one man through,
and then I was struck.... O-oh! softly, brothers!
steady, brothers! go more steadily!...
O-oh!&#8221; groaned the wounded man.</p>

<p>&#8220;There really seem to be a great many extra
men coming this way,&#8221; said Galtsin, again stopping
the tall soldier with the two rifles. &#8220;Why
are you walking off? Hey there, halt!&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier halted, and removed his cap with
his left hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going, and why?&#8221; he shouted
at him sternly. &#8220;He ...&#8221;</p>

<p>But, approaching the soldier very closely at that
moment, he perceived that the latter's right arm
was bandaged, and covered with blood far above
the elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am wounded, Your Honor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wounded? how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been a bullet, here!&#8221; said the
soldier, pointing at his arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> &#8220;but I cannot tell
yet. My head has been broken by something,&#8221;
and, bending over, he showed the hair upon the
back of it all clotted together with blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;And whose gun is that second one you
have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A choice French one, Your Honor! I captured
it. And I should not have come away if it
had not been to accompany this soldier; he might
fall down,&#8221; he added, pointing at the soldier, who
was walking a little in front, leaning upon his gun,
and dragging his left foot heavily after him.</p>

<p>Prince Galtsin all at once became frightfully
ashamed of his unjust suspicions. He felt that
he was growing crimson, and turned away, without
questioning the wounded men further, and,
without looking after them, he went to the place
where the injured men were being cared for.</p>

<p>Having forced his way with difficulty to the
porch, through the wounded men who had come
on foot, and the stretcher-bearers, who were entering
with the wounded and emerging with the
dead, Galtsin entered the first room, glanced
round, and involuntarily turned back, and immediately
ran into the street. It was too terrible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>The vast, dark, lofty hall, lighted only by the
four or five candles, which the doctors were
carrying about to inspect the wounded, was literally
full. The stretcher-bearers brought in the
wounded, ranged them one beside another on
the floor, which was already so crowded that
the unfortunate wretches hustled each other
and sprinkled each other with their blood, and
then went forth for more. The pools of blood
which were visible on the unoccupied places,
the hot breaths of several hundred men, and
the steam which rose from those who were toiling
with the stretchers produced a peculiar, thick,
heavy, offensive atmosphere, in which the candles
burned dimly in the different parts of the room.
The dull murmur of diverse groans, sighs, death-rattles,
broken now and again by a shriek, was
borne throughout the apartment. Sisters of
charity, with tranquil faces, and with an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
not of empty, feminine, tearfully sickly compassion,
but of active, practical sympathy, flitted
hither and thither among the blood-stained cloaks
and shirts, stepping over the wounded, with medicine,
water, bandages, lint.</p>

<p>Doctors, with their sleeves rolled up, knelt
beside the wounded, beside whom the assistant
surgeons held the candles, inspecting, feeling,
and probing the wounds, in spite of the terrible
groans and entreaties of the sufferers. One of
the doctors was seated at a small table by the
door, and, at the moment when Galtsin entered
the room, he was just writing down &#8220;No. 532.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Iván Bogaeff, common soldier, third company
of the S&#8212;&#8212; regiment, <i>fractura femoris complicata</i>!&#8221;
called another from the extremity of the
hall, as he felt of the crushed leg.... &#8220;Turn
him over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O-oi, my fathers, good fathers!&#8221; shrieked the
soldier, beseeching them not to touch him.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Perforatio capitis.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Semyon Neferdoff, lieutenant-colonel of the
N&#8212;&#8212; regiment of infantry. Have a little patience,
colonel: you can only be attended to this way;
I will let you alone,&#8221; said a third, picking away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
at the head of the unfortunate colonel, with
some sort of a hook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ai! stop! Oi! for God's sake, quick, quick,
for the sake a-a-a-a!...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Perforatio pectoris</i> ... Sevastyan Sereda, common
soldier ... of what regiment? however, you
need not write that: <i>moritur</i>. Carry him away,&#8221;
said the doctor, abandoning the soldier, who was
rolling his eyes, and already emitting the death-rattle.</p>

<p>Forty stretcher-bearers stood at the door,
awaiting the task of transporting to the hospital
the men who had been attended to, and the
dead to the chapel, and gazed at this picture
in silence, only uttering a heavy sigh from time
to time....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>On his way to the bastion, Kalugin met numerous
wounded men; but, knowing from experience
that such a spectacle has a bad effect
on the spirits of a man on the verge of an
action, he not only did not pause to interrogate
them, but, on the contrary, he tried not
to pay any heed to them. At the foot of the
hill he encountered an orderly, who was galloping
from the bastion at full speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zobkin! Zobkin! Stop a minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the lodgements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how are things there! Hot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, frightfully!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the orderly galloped on.</p>

<p>In fact, although there was not much firing
from the rifles, the cannonade had begun with
fresh vigor and greater heat than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that's bad!&#8221; thought Kalugin, experiencing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a rather unpleasant sensation, and there
came to him also a presentiment, that is to say,
a very usual thought&#8212;the thought of death.</p>

<p>But Kalugin was an egotist and gifted with
nerves of steel; in a word, he was what is called
brave. He did not yield to his first sensation,
and began to arouse his courage; he recalled
to mind a certain adjutant of Napoleon, who,
after having given the command to advance,
galloped up to Napoleon, his head all covered
with blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wounded?&#8221; said Napoleon to him.
&#8220;I beg your pardon, Sire, I am dead,&#8221;&#8212;and
the adjutant fell from his horse, and died on
the spot.</p>

<p>This seemed very fine to him, and he fancied
that he somewhat resembled this adjutant; then
he gave his horse a blow with the whip; and assumed
still more of that knowing Cossack bearing,
glanced at his orderly, who was galloping
behind him, standing upright in his stirrups,
and thus in dashing style he reached the place
where it was necessary to dismount. Here he
found four soldiers, who were smoking their pipes
as they sat on the stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; he shouted at
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been carrying a wounded man from
the field, Your Honor, and have sat down to
rest,&#8221; one of them replied, concealing his pipe
behind his back, and pulling off his cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Resting indeed! March off to your posts!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, in company with them, he walked up
the hill through the trenches, encountering
wounded men at every step.</p>

<p>On attaining the crest of the hill, he turned to
the left, and, after taking a few steps, found himself
quite alone. Splinters whizzed near him, and
struck in the trenches. Another bomb rose in
front of him, and seemed to be flying straight at
him. All of a sudden he felt terrified; he ran
off five paces at full speed, and lay down on the
ground. But when the bomb burst, and at a
distance from him, he grew dreadfully vexed at
himself, and glanced about as he rose, to see
whether any one had perceived him fall, but
there was no one about.</p>

<p>When fear has once made its way into the
mind, it does not speedily give way to another
feeling. He, who had boasted that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
never bend, hastened along the trench with
accelerated speed, and almost on his hands and
knees. &#8220;Ah! this is very bad!&#8221; he thought,
as he stumbled. &#8220;I shall certainly be killed!&#8221;
And, conscious of how difficult it was for him
to breathe, and that the perspiration was breaking
out all over his body, he was amazed at
himself, but he no longer strove to conquer
his feelings.</p>

<p>All at once steps became audible in advance
of him. He quickly straightened himself up,
raised his head, and, boldly clanking his sword,
began to proceed at a slower pace than before.
He did not know himself. When he joined the
officer of sappers and the sailor who were coming
to meet him, and the former called to him,
&#8220;Lie down,&#8221; pointing to the bright speck of
a bomb, which, growing ever brighter and
brighter, swifter and swifter, as it approached,
crashed down in the vicinity of the trench, he
only bent his head a very little, involuntarily,
under the influence of the terrified shout, and
went his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! what a brave man!&#8221; ejaculated the
sailor, who had calmly watched the exploding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
bomb, and, with practised glance, at once calculated
that its splinters could not strike inside
the trench; &#8220;he did not even wish to lie
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only a few steps remained to be taken, across
an open space, before Kalugin would reach the
casemate of the commander of the bastion, when
he was again attacked by dimness of vision and
that stupid sensation of fear; his heart began
to beat more violently, the blood rushed to
his head, and he was obliged to exert an effort
over himself in order to reach the casemate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so out of breath?&#8221; inquired the
general, when Kalugin had communicated to him
his orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been walking very fast, Your Excellency!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you not take a glass of wine?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kalugin drank the wine, and lighted a cigarette.
The engagement had already come to an
end; only the heavy cannonade continued, going
on from both sides.</p>

<p>In the casemate sat General N., the commander
of the bastion, and six other officers, among whom
was Praskukhin, discussing various details of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
conflict. Seated in this comfortable apartment,
with blue hangings, with a sofa, a bed, a table,
covered with papers, a wall clock, and the holy
pictures, before which burned a lamp, and gazing
upon these signs of habitation, and at the arshin-thick
(twenty-eight inches) beams which formed
the ceiling, and listening to the shots, which were
deadened by the casemate, Kalugin positively
could not understand how he had twice permitted
himself to be overcome with such unpardonable
weakness. He was angry with himself, and he
longed for danger, in order that he might subject
himself to another trial.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad that you are here, captain,&#8221;
he said to a naval officer, in the cloak of staff-officer,
with a large moustache and the cross
of St. George, who entered the casemate at
that moment, and asked the general to give
him some men, that he might repair the two
embrasures on his battery, which had been
demolished. &#8220;The general ordered me to inquire,&#8221;
continued Kalugin, when the commander
of the battery ceased to address the general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
&#8220;whether your guns can fire grape-shot into
the trenches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only one of my guns will do that,&#8221; replied the
captain, gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go and see, all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain frowned, and grunted angrily:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already passed the whole night there,
and I came here to try and get a little rest,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;Cannot you go alone? My assistant,
Lieutenant Kartz, is there, and he will show you
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain had now been for six months in
command of this, one of the most dangerous of the
batteries&#8212;and even when there were no casemates
he had lived, without relief, in the bastion
and among the sailors, from the beginning of the
siege, and he bore a reputation among them for
bravery. Therefore his refusal particularly struck
and amazed Kalugin. &#8220;That's what reputation
is worth!&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I will go alone, if you will permit
it,&#8221; he said, in a somewhat bantering tone to the
captain, who, however, paid not the slightest heed
to his words.</p>

<p>But Kalugin did not reflect that he had passed,
in all, at different times, perhaps fifty hours on the
bastion, while the captain had lived there for six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
months. Kalugin was actuated, moreover, by
vanity, by a desire to shine, by the hope of
reward, of reputation, and by the charm of risk;
but the captain had already gone through all that:
he had been vain at first, he had displayed valor, he
had risked his life, he had hoped for fame and guerdon,
and had even obtained them, but these actuating
motives had already lost their power over him,
and he regarded the matter in another light; he
fulfilled his duty with punctuality, but understanding
quite well how small were the chances for
his life which were left him, after a six-months residence
in the bastion, he no longer risked these
casualties, except in case of stern necessity, so that
the young lieutenant, who had entered the battery
only a week previous, and who was now showing
it to Kalugin, in company with whom he took
turns in leaning out of the embrasure, or climbing
out on the ramparts, seemed ten times as
brave as the captain.</p>

<p>After inspecting the battery, Kalugin returned
to the casemate, and ran against the general in
the dark, as the latter was ascending to the
watch-tower with his staff-officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Praskukhin!&#8221; said the general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
&#8220;please to go to the first lodgement and say to the
second battery of the M&#8212;&#8212; regiment, which is
at work there, that they are to abandon their
work, to evacuate the place without making any
noise, and to join their regiment, which is standing
at the foot of the hill in reserve.... Do
you understand? Lead them to their regiment
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Praskukhin set out for the lodgement on a
run.</p>

<p>The firing was growing more infrequent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Is this the second battalion of the M&#8212;&#8212;
regiment?&#8221; asked Praskukhin, hastening up to
the spot, and running against the soldiers who
were carrying earth in sacks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the commander?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mikhaïloff, supposing that the inquiry was for
the commander of the corps, crawled out of his
pit, and, taking Praskukhin for the colonel, he
stepped up to him with his hand at his visor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The general has given orders ... that you
... are to be so good as to go ... as quickly as
possible ... and, in particular, as quietly as
possible, to the rear ... not to the rear exactly,
but to the reserve,&#8221; said Praskukhin, glancing
askance at the enemy's fires.</p>

<p>On recognizing Praskukhin and discovering the
state of things, Mikhaïloff dropped his hand, gave
his orders, and the battalion started into motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
gathered up their guns, put on their cloaks, and
set out.</p>

<p>No one who has not experienced it can imagine
the delight which a man feels when he takes his
departure, after a three-hours bombardment, from
such a dangerous post as the lodgements. Several
times in the course of those three hours, Mikhaïloff
had, not without reason, considered his
<i>end</i> as inevitable, and had grown accustomed to
the conviction that he should infallibly be killed,
and that he no longer belonged to this world. In
spite of this, however, he had great difficulty in
keeping his feet from running away with him
when he issued from the lodgements at the head of
his corps, in company with Praskukhin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Au revoir,&#8221; said the major, the commander of
another battalion, who was to remain in the
lodgements, and with whom he had shared his
cheese, as they sat in the pit behind the breastworks&#8212;&#8220;a
pleasant journey to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, I hope you will have good luck after
we have gone. The firing seems to be holding up.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no sooner had he said this than the enemy,
who must have observed the movement in the
lodgements, began to fire faster and faster. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
guns began to reply to him, and again a heavy
cannonade began. The stars were gleaming
high, but not brilliantly in the sky. The night
was dark&#8212;you could hardly see your hand before
you; only the flashes of the discharges and the
explosions of the bombs illuminated objects for a
moment. The soldiers marched on rapidly, in
silence, involuntarily treading close on each
other's heels; all that was audible through the
incessant firing was the measured sound of
their footsteps on the dry road, the noise of their
bayonets as they came in contact, or the sigh and
prayer of some young soldier, &#8220;Lord, Lord!
what is this!&#8221; Now and then the groan of a
wounded man arose, and the shout, &#8220;Stretcher!&#8221;
(In the company commanded by Mikhaïloff,
twenty-six men were killed in one night, by the
fire of the artillery alone.) The lightning flashed
against the distant horizon, the sentry in the bastion
shouted, &#8220;Can-non!&#8221; and the ball, shrieking
over the heads of the corps, tore up the earth,
and sent the stones flying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deuce take it! how slowly they march,&#8221;
thought Praskukhin, glancing back continually, as
he walked beside Mikhaïloff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> &#8220;Really, it will be
better for me to run on in front; I have already
given the order.... But no, it might be said later
on that I was a coward. What will be will be;
I will march with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, why is he walking behind me?&#8221; thought
Mikhaïloff, on his side. &#8220;So far as I have observed,
he always brings ill-luck. There it comes, flying
straight for us, apparently.&#8221;</p>

<p>After traversing several hundred paces, they
encountered Kalugin, who was going to the
casemates, clanking his sword boldly as he
walked, in order to learn, by the general's command,
how the work was progressing there. But
on meeting Mikhaïloff, it occurred to him that,
instead of going thither, under that terrible fire,
which he was not ordered to do, he could make
minute inquiries of the officer who had been there.
And, in fact, Mikhaïloff furnished him with a
detailed account of the work. After walking a
short distance with them, Kalugin turned into the
trench, which led to the casemate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what news is there?&#8221; inquired the officer,
who was seated alone at the table, and eating
his supper.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, nothing, apparently, except that there
will not be any further conflict.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How so? On the contrary, the general has
but just gone up to the top of the works. A
regiment has already arrived. Yes, there it is ...
do you hear? The firing has begun again. Don't
go. Why should you?&#8221; added the officer, perceiving
the movement made by Kalugin.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must be there without fail, in the
present instance,&#8221; thought Kalugin, &#8220;but I have
already subjected myself to a good deal of danger
to-day; the firing is terrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, after all, I had better wait for him
here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>In fact, the general returned, twenty minutes
later, accompanied by the officers, who had been
with him; among their number was the yunker,
Baron Pesth, but Praskukhin was not with them.
The lodgements had been captured and occupied
by our forces.</p>

<p>After receiving a full account of the engagement,
Kalugin and Pesth went out of the casemates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>&#8220;There is blood on your cloak; have you been
having a hand-to-hand fight?&#8221; Kalugin asked
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, 'tis frightful! Just imagine....&#8221;</p>

<p>And Pesth began to relate how he had led his
company, how the commander of the company had
been killed, how he had spitted a Frenchman, and
how, if it had not been for him, the battle would
have been lost.</p>

<p>The foundations for this tale, that the company
commander had been killed, and that Pesth
had killed a Frenchman, were correct; but, in
giving the details, the yunker had invented facts
and bragged.</p>

<p>He bragged involuntarily, because, during the
whole engagement, he had been in a kind of mist,
and had forgotten himself to such a degree that
everything which happened seemed to him to have
happened somewhere, sometime, and with some
one, and very naturally he had endeavored to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
bring out these details in a light which should be
favorable to himself. But what had happened in
reality was this:&#8212;</p>

<p>The battalion to which the yunker had been
ordered for the sortie had stood under fire for
two hours, near a wall; then the commander of
the battalion said something, the company commanders
made a move, the battalion got under
way, issued forth from behind the breastworks,
marched forward a hundred paces, and came to a
halt in columns. Pesth had been ordered to take
his stand on the right flank of the second company.</p>

<p>The yunker stood his ground, absolutely without
knowing where he was, or why he was there,
and, with restrained breath, and with a cold chill
running down his spine, he had stared stupidly
straight ahead into the dark beyond, in the expectation
of something terrible. But, since there
was no firing in progress, he did not feel so much
terrified as he did queer and strange at finding
himself outside the fortress, in the open plain.
Again the battalion commander ahead said something.
Again the officers had conversed in
whispers, as they communicated the orders, and
the black wall of the first company suddenly disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
They had been ordered to lie down.
The second company lay down also, and Pesth, in
the act, pricked his hand on something sharp.
The only man who did not lie down was the commander
of the second company. His short form,
with the naked sword which he was flourishing,
talking incessantly the while, moved about in
front of the troop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children! my lads! ... look at me! Don't
fire at them, but at them with your bayonets,
the dogs! When I shout, Hurrah! follow me
close ... the chief thing is to be as close together
as possible ... let us show what we are made of!
Do not let us cover ourselves with shame&#8212;shall
we, hey, my children? For our father the
Tsar!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is our company commander's surname?&#8221;
Pesth inquired of a yunker, who was
lying beside him. &#8220;What a brave fellow he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he's always that way in a fight ...&#8221;
answered the yunker. &#8220;His name is Lisinkovsky.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, a flame flashed up in front of
the company. There was a crash, which deafened
them all, stones and splinters flew high in the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
(fifty seconds, at least, later a stone fell from
above and crushed the foot of a soldier). This
was a bomb from an elevated platform, and the
fact that it fell in the midst of the company
proved that the French had caught sight of the
column.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they are sending bombs!... Just let us
get at you, and you shall feel the bayonet of a
three-sided Russian, curse you!&#8221; shouted the
commander of the company, in so loud a tone that
the battalion commander was forced to order him
to be quiet and not to make so much noise.</p>

<p>After this the first company rose to their feet,
and after it the second. They were ordered to
fix bayonets, and the battalion advanced. Pesth
was so terrified that he absolutely could not
recollect whether they advanced far, or whither,
or who did what. He walked like a drunken
man. But all at once millions of fires flashed
from all sides, there was a whistling and a crashing.
He shrieked and ran, because they were all
shrieking and running. Then he stumbled and
fell upon something. It was the company commander
(who had been wounded at the head of
his men and who, taking the yunker for a Frenchman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
seized him by the leg). Then when he had
freed his leg, and risen to his feet, some man ran
against his back in the dark and almost knocked
him down again; another man shouted, &#8220;Run him
through! what are you staring at!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he seized a gun, and ran the bayonet
into something soft. &#8220;Ah, Dieu!&#8221; exclaimed
some one in a terribly piercing voice, and then
only did Pesth discover that he had transfixed
a Frenchman. The cold sweat started out all
over his body. He shook as though in a fever,
and flung away the gun. But this lasted only a
moment; it immediately occurred to him that he
was a hero. He seized the gun again, and, shouting
&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; with the crowd, he rushed away
from the dead Frenchman. After having traversed
about twenty paces, he came to the trench.
There he found our men and the company commander.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have run one man through!&#8221; he said to the
commander.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;You're a brave fellow, Baron.&#8221;</p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>&#8220;But, do you know, Praskukhin has been
killed,&#8221; said Pesth, accompanying Kalugin, on the
way back.</p>

<p>&#8220;It cannot be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it can. I saw him myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell; I am in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am well content,&#8221; thought Kalugin, as he
returned home; &#8220;I have had luck for the first
time when on duty. That was a capital engagement,
and I am alive and whole. There will be
some fine presentations, and I shall certainly get a
golden sword. And I deserve it too.&#8221;</p>

<p>After reporting to the general all that was
necessary, he went to his room, in which sat
Prince Galtsin, who had returned long before,
and who was reading a book, which he had found
on Kalugin's table, while waiting for him.</p>

<p>It was with a wonderful sense of enjoyment
that Kalugin found himself at home again, out of
all danger, and, having donned his night-shirt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
lain down on the sofa, he began to relate to
Galtsin the particulars of the affair, communicating
them, naturally, from a point of view which
made it appear that he, Kalugin, was a very
active and valiant officer, to which, in my opinion,
it was superfluous to refer, seeing that every
one knew it and that no one had any right to
doubt it, with the exception, perhaps, of the
deceased Captain Praskukhin, who, in spite of the
fact that he had considered it a piece of happiness
to walk arm in arm with Kalugin, had told a
friend, only the evening before, in private, that
Kalugin was a very fine man, but that, between
you and me, he was terribly averse to going to the
bastions.</p>

<p>No sooner had Praskukhin, who had been walking
beside Mikhaïloff, taken leave of Kalugin, and,
betaking himself to a safer place, had begun to
recover his spirits somewhat, than he caught sight
of a flash of lightning behind him flaring up
vividly, heard the shout of the sentinel, &#8220;Mortar!&#8221;
and the words of the soldiers who were
marching behind, &#8220;It's flying straight at the
bastion!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mikhaïloff glanced round. The brilliant point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of the bomb seemed to be suspended directly over
his head in such a position that it was absolutely
impossible to determine its course. But this
lasted only for a second. The bomb came faster
and faster, nearer and nearer, the sparks of the
fuse were already visible, and the fateful whistle
was audible, and it descended straight in the
middle of the battalion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie down!&#8221; shouted a voice.</p>

<p>Mikhaïloff and Praskukhin threw themselves on
the ground. Praskukhin shut his eyes, and only
heard the bomb crash against the hard earth
somewhere in the vicinity. A second passed,
which seemed an hour&#8212;and the bomb had not
burst. Praskukhin was alarmed; had he felt
cowardly for nothing? Perhaps the bomb had
fallen at a distance, and it merely seemed to him
that the fuse was hissing near him. He opened
his eyes, and saw with satisfaction that Mikhaïloff
was lying motionless on the earth, at his very
feet. But then his eyes encountered for a moment
the glowing fuse of the bomb, which
was twisting about at a distance of an arshin
from him.</p>

<p>A cold horror, which excluded every other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
thought and feeling, took possession of his whole
being. He covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>Another second passed&#8212;a second in which a
whole world of thoughts, feelings, hopes, and
memories flashed through his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which will be killed, Mikhaïloff or I? Or
both together? And if it is I, where will it
strike? If in the head, then all is over with me;
but if in the leg, they will cut it off, and I shall
ask them to be sure to give me chloroform,&#8212;and
I may still remain among the living. But perhaps
no one but Mikhaïloff will be killed; then I will
relate how we were walking along together, and
how he was killed and his blood spurted over me.
No, it is nearer to me ... it will kill me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he remembered the twenty rubles which
he owed Mikhaïloff, and recalled another debt in
Petersburg, which ought to have been paid long
ago; the gypsy air which he had sung the previous
evening recurred to him. The woman whom he
loved appeared to his imagination in a cap with
lilac ribbons, a man who had insulted him five
years before, and whom he had not paid off for
his insult, came to his mind, though inextricably
interwoven with these and with a thousand other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
memories the feeling of the moment&#8212;the fear of
death&#8212;never deserted him for an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;But perhaps it will not burst,&#8221; he thought,
and, with the decision of despair, he tried to open
his eyes. But at that instant, through the crevice
of his eyelids, his eyes were smitten with a red fire,
and something struck him in the centre of the
breast, with a frightful crash; he ran off, he knew
not whither, stumbled over his sword, which had
got between his legs, and fell over on his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God! I am only bruised,&#8221; was his
first thought, and he tried to touch his breast with
his hands; but his arms seemed fettered, and
pincers were pressing his head. The soldiers
flitted before his eyes, and he unconsciously
counted them: &#8220;One, two, three soldiers; and
there is an officer, wrapped up in his cloak,&#8221; he
thought. Then a flash passed before his eyes,
and he thought that something had been fired off;
was it the mortars, or the cannon? It must have
been the cannon. And there was still another
shot; and there were more soldiers; five, six,
seven soldiers were passing by him. Then suddenly
he felt afraid that they would crush him.
He wanted to shout to them that he was bruised;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
but his mouth was so dry that his tongue clove
to his palate and he was tortured by a frightful
thirst.</p>

<p>He felt that he was wet about the breast:
this sensation of dampness reminded him of
water, and he even wanted to drink this, whatever
it was. &#8220;I must have brought the blood when I
fell,&#8221; he thought, and, beginning to give way more
and more to terror, lest the soldiers who passed
should crush him, he collected all his strength,
and tried to cry: &#8220;Take me with you!&#8221; but,
instead of this, he groaned so terribly that
it frightened him to hear himself. Then more
red fires flashed in his eyes&#8212;and it seemed to
him as though the soldiers were laying stones
upon him; the fires danced more and more rarely,
the stones which they piled on him oppressed
him more and more.</p>

<p>He exerted all his strength, in order to cast
off the stones; he stretched himself out, and
no longer saw or heard or thought or felt anything.
He had been killed on the spot by a
splinter of shell, in the middle of the breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>Mikhaïloff, on catching sight of the bomb, fell
to the earth, and, like Praskukhin, he went over
in thought and feeling an incredible amount in
those two seconds while the bomb lay there unexploded.
He prayed to God mentally, and kept
repeating: &#8220;Thy will be done!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why did I enter the military service?&#8221; he
thought at the same time; &#8220;and why, again, did
I exchange into the infantry, in order to take part
in this campaign? Would it not have been better
for me to remain in the regiment of Uhlans, in
the town of T., and pass the time with my friend
Natasha? And now this is what has come of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he began to count, &#8220;One, two, three, four,&#8221;
guessing that if it burst on the even number, he
would live, but if on the uneven number, then he
should be killed. &#8220;All is over; killed,&#8221; he thought,
when the bomb burst (he did not remember
whether it was on the even or the uneven number),
and he felt a blow, and a sharp pain in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
head. &#8220;Lord, forgive my sins,&#8221; he murmured, folding
his hands, then rose, and fell back senseless.</p>

<p>His first sensation, when he came to himself,
was the blood which was flowing from his nose,
and a pain in his head, which had become much
less powerful. &#8220;It is my soul departing,&#8221; he
thought.&#8212;&#8220;What will it be like <i>there</i>? Lord,
receive my soul in peace!&#8212;But one thing is
strange,&#8221; he thought,&#8212;&#8220;and that is that, though
dying, I can still hear so plainly the footsteps of
the soldiers and the report of the shots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send some bearers ... hey there ... the
captain is killed!&#8221; shouted a voice over his head,
which he recognized as the voice of his drummer
Ignatieff.</p>

<p>Some one grasped him by the shoulders. He
made an effort to open his eyes, and saw overhead
the dark blue heavens, the clusters of stars, and
two bombs, which were flying over him, one after
the other; he saw Ignatieff, the soldiers with the
stretcher, the walls of the trench, and all at once
he became convinced that he was not yet in the
other world.</p>

<p>He had been slightly wounded in the head with
a stone. His very first impression was one resembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
regret; he had so beautifully and so
calmly prepared himself for transit <i>yonder</i> that a
return to reality, with its bombs, its trenches, and
its blood, produced a disagreeable effect on him;
his second impression was an involuntary joy
that he was alive, and the third a desire to leave
the bastion as speedily as possible. The drummer
bound up his commander's head with his
handkerchief, and, taking him under the arm, he
led him to the place where the bandaging was
going on.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where am I going, and why?&#8221; thought
the staff-captain, when he recovered his senses a
little.&#8212;&#8220;It is my duty to remain with my men,&#8212;the
more so as they will soon be out of range of
the shots,&#8221; some voice whispered to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, brother,&#8221; he said, pulling his
arm away from the obliging drummer. &#8220;I will
not go to the field-hospital; I will remain with
my men.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he turned back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better have your wound properly
attended to, Your Honor,&#8221; said Ignatieff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> &#8220;In
the heat of the moment, it seems as if it were a
trifle; but it will be the worse if not attended to.
There is some inflammation rising there ... really,
now, Your Honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mikhaïloff paused for a moment in indecision,
and would have followed Ignatieff's advice, in all
probability, had he not called to mind how many
severely wounded men there must needs be at
the field-hospital. &#8220;Perhaps the doctor will
smile at my scratch,&#8221; thought the staff-captain,
and he returned with decision to his men, wholly
regardless of the drummer's admonitions.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where is Officer Praskukhin, who was
walking with me?&#8221; he asked the lieutenant, who
was leading the corps when they met.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know&#8212;killed, probably,&#8221; replied the
lieutenant, reluctantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it that you do not know whether he
was killed or wounded? He was walking with us.
And why have you not carried him with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could it be done, brother, when the
place was so hot for us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, how could you do such a thing, Mikhaïl
Ivánowitch!&#8221; said Mikhaïloff, angrily.&#8212;&#8220;How
could you abandon him if he was alive; and if he
was dead, you should still have brought away his
body.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;How could he be alive when, as I tell you, I
went up to him and saw!&#8221; returned the lieutenant.&#8212;&#8220;As
you like, however! Only, his own
men might carry him off. Here, you dogs! the
cannonade has abated,&#8221; he added....</p>

<p>Mikhaïloff sat down, and clasped his head,
which the motion caused to pain him terribly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I must go and get him, without fail;
perhaps he is still alive,&#8221; said Mikhaïloff. &#8220;It
is our duty, Mikhaïl Ivánowitch!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mikhaïl Ivánowitch made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not take him at the time, and now the
soldiers must be sent alone&#8212;and how can they be
sent? their lives may be sacrificed in vain, under
that hot fire,&#8221; thought Mikhaïloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children! we must go back&#8212;and get the
officer who was wounded there in the ditch,&#8221; he
said, in not too loud and commanding a tone, for
he felt how unpleasant it would be to the soldiers
to obey his order,&#8212;and, in fact, as he did not
address any one in particular by name, no one set
out to fulfil it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite possible that he is already dead,
and it is <i>not worth while</i> to subject the men to
unnecessary danger; I alone am to blame for not
having seen to it. I will go myself and learn
whether he is alive. It is my duty,&#8221; said Mikhaïloff
to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mikhaïl Ivánowitch! Lead the men forward,
and I will overtake you,&#8221; he said, and, pulling up
his cloak with one hand, and with the other constantly
touching the image of Saint Mitrofaniy,
in which he cherished a special faith, he set off on
a run along the trench.</p>

<p>Having convinced himself that Praskukhin was
dead, he dragged himself back, panting, and supporting
with his hand the loosened bandage and
his head, which began to pain him severely. The
battalion had already reached the foot of the hill,
and a place almost out of range of shots, when
Mikhaïloff overtook it. I say, <i>almost</i> out of
range, because some stray bombs struck here
and there.</p>

<p>&#8220;At all events, I must go to the hospital to-morrow,
and put down my name,&#8221; thought the
staff-captain, as the medical student assisting the
doctors bound his wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>


<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>Hundreds of bodies, freshly smeared with blood,
of men who two hours previous had been filled
with divers lofty or petty hopes and desires, now
lay, with stiffened limbs, in the dewy, flowery
valley which separated the bastion from the
trench, and on the level floor of the chapel for the
dead in Sevastopol; hundreds of men crawled,
twisted, and groaned, with curses and prayers on
their parched lips, some amid the corpses in the
flower-strewn vale, others on stretchers, on cots,
and on the blood-stained floor of the hospital.</p>

<p>And still, as on the days preceding, the dawn
glowed, over Sapun Mountain, the twinkling stars
paled, the white mist spread abroad from the dark
sounding sea, the red glow illuminated the east,
long crimson cloudlets darted across the blue
horizon; and still, as on days preceding, the
powerful, all-beautiful sun rose up, giving promise
of joy, love, and happiness to all who dwell in
the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>


<h3>XV.</h3>

<p>On the following day, the band of the chasseurs
was playing again on the boulevard, and again
officers, cadets, soldiers, and young women were
promenading in festive guise about the pavilion
and through the low-hanging alleys of fragrant
white acacias in bloom.</p>

<p>Kalugin, Prince Galtsin, and some colonel or
other were walking arm-in-arm near the pavilion,
and discussing the engagement of the day before.
As always happens in such cases, the chief governing
thread of the conversation was not the
engagement itself, but the part which those
who were narrating the story of the affair took
in it.</p>

<p>Their faces and the sound of their voices had
a serious, almost melancholy expression, as though
the loss of the preceding day had touched and
saddened them deeply; but, to tell the truth, as
none of them had lost any one very near to him,
this expression of sorrow was an official expression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
which they merely felt it to be their duty to
exhibit.</p>

<p>On the contrary, Kalugin and the colonel were
ready to see an engagement of the same sort
every day, provided that they might receive a
gold sword or the rank of major-general&#8212;notwithstanding
the fact that they were very fine fellows.</p>

<p>I like it when any warrior who destroys millions
to gratify his ambition is called a monster.
Only question any Lieutenant Petrushkoff, and
Sub-Lieutenant Antonoff, and so on, on their
word of honor, and every one of them is a petty
Napoleon, a petty monster, and ready to bring on
a battle on the instant, to murder a hundred men,
merely for the sake of receiving an extra cross
or an increase of a third in his pay.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, excuse me,&#8221; said the colonel; &#8220;it began
first on the left flank. <i>I was there myself.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; answered Kalugin. &#8220;<i>I was farther
on the right; I went there twice. Once I was in
search of the general, and the second time I went
merely to inspect the lodgements. It was a hot
place.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course, Kalugin knows,&#8221; said Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Galtsin to the colonel. &#8220;You know that V. told
me to-day that you were a brave fellow....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the losses, the losses were terrible,&#8221; said
the colonel. &#8220;<i>I lost four hundred men from my
regiment. It's a wonder that I escaped from there
alive.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment, the figure of Mikhaïloff, with
his head bandaged, appeared at the other extremity
of the boulevard, coming to meet these
gentlemen.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, are you wounded, captain?&#8221; said
Kalugin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, slightly, with a stone,&#8221; replied Mikhaïloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the flag been lowered yet?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> inquired
Prince Galtsin, gazing over the staff-captain's
cap, and addressing himself to no one in particular.</p>

<p>&#8220;Non, pas encore,&#8221; answered Mikhaïloff, who
wished to show that he understood and spoke
French.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the truce still in force?&#8221; said Galtsin,
addressing him courteously in Russian, and
thereby intimating&#8212;so it seemed to the captain&#8212;It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
must be difficult for you to speak
French, so why is it not better to talk in your
own tongue simply?... And with this the
adjutants left him. The staff-captain again felt
lonely, as on the preceding evening, and, exchanging
salutes with various gentlemen,&#8212;some
he did not care, and others he did not dare,
to join,&#8212;he seated himself near Kazarsky's monument,
and lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>Baron Pesth also had come to the boulevard.
He had been telling how he had gone over to
arrange the truce, and had conversed with the
French officers, and he declared that one had
said to him, &#8220;If daylight had held off another
half-hour, these ambushes would have been retaken;&#8221;
and that he had replied, &#8220;Sir, I refrain
from saying no, in order not to give you the
lie,&#8221; and how well he had said it, and so on.</p>

<p>But, in reality, although he had had a hand
in the truce, he had not dared to say anything
very particular there, although he had been very
desirous of talking with the French (for it is
awfully jolly to talk with Frenchmen). Yunker
Baron Pesth had marched up and down the
line for a long time, incessantly inquiring of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the Frenchmen who were near him: &#8220;To what
regiment do you belong?&#8221; They answered him;
and that was the end of it.</p>

<p>When he walked too far along the line, the
French sentry, not suspecting that this soldier
understood French, cursed him. &#8220;He has come
to spy out our works, the cursed ...&#8221; said he;
and, in consequence, Yunker Baron Pesth, taking
no further interest in the truce, went
home, and thought out on the way thither
those French phrases, which he had now repeated.
Captain Zoboff was also on the boulevard,
talking loudly, and Captain Obzhogoff, in
a very dishevelled condition, and an artillery
captain, who courted no one, and was happy
in the love of the yunkers, and all the faces
which had been there on the day before, and
all still actuated by the same motives. No one
was missing except Praskukhin, Neferdoff, and
some others, whom hardly any one remembered
or thought of now, though their bodies were not
yet washed, laid out, and interred in the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>


<h3>XVI.</h3>

<p>White flags had been hung out from our
bastion, and from the trenches of the French,
and in the blooming valley between them lay
disfigured corpses, shoeless, in garments of gray
or blue, which laborers were engaged in carrying
off and heaping upon carts. The odor of
the dead bodies filled the air. Throngs of
people had poured out of Sevastopol, and from
the French camp, to gaze upon this spectacle,
and they pressed one after the other with eager
and benevolent curiosity.</p>

<p>Listen to what these people are saying.</p>

<p>Here, in a group of Russians and French
who have come together, is a young officer,
who speaks French badly, but well enough to
make himself understood, examining a cartridge-box
of the guards.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is this bird here for?&#8221; says he.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because it is a cartridge-box belonging to
a regiment of the guards, Monsieur, and bears
the Imperial eagle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you belong to the guard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, Monsieur, I belong to the sixth regiment
of the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this&#8212;bought where?&#8221; asks the officer,
pointing to a cigar-holder of yellow wood, in
which the Frenchman was smoking his cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;At Balaklava, Monsieur. It is very plain,
of palm-wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty!&#8221; says the officer, guided in his conversation
not so much by his own wishes as
by the words which he knows.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will have the kindness to keep it as
a souvenir of this meeting, you will confer an
obligation on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the polite Frenchman blows out the
cigarette, and hands the holder over to the
officer with a little bow. The officer gives him
his, and all the members of the group, Frenchmen
as well as Russians, appear very much pleased
and smile.</p>

<p>Then a bold infantryman, in a pink shirt,
with his cloak thrown over his shoulders, accompanied
by two other soldiers, who, with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
hands behind their backs, were standing behind
him, with merry, curious countenances, stepped
up to a Frenchman, and requested a light for
his pipe. The Frenchman brightened his fire,
stirred up his short pipe, and shook out a light
for the Russian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tobacco good!&#8221; said the soldier in the pink
shirt; and the spectators smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, good tobacco, Turkish tobacco,&#8221; says
the Frenchman. &#8220;And your tobacco&#8212;Russian?&#8212;good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Russian, good,&#8221; says the soldier in the pink
shirt: whereupon those present shake with laughter.
&#8220;The French not good&#8212;<i>bon jour, Monsieur</i>,&#8221;
says the soldier in the pink shirt, letting
fly his entire charge of knowledge in the language
at once, as he laughs and taps the Frenchman
on the stomach. The French join in the
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not handsome, these beasts of
Russians,&#8221; says a zouave, amid the crowd of
Frenchmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they laughing about?&#8221; says another
black-complexioned one, with an Italian accent,
approaching our men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Caftan good,&#8221; says the audacious soldier, staring
at the zouave's embroidered coat-skirts, and
then there is another laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't leave your lines; back to your places,
<i>sacré nom</i>!&#8221; shouts a French corporal, and the
soldiers disperse with evident reluctance.</p>

<p>In the meantime, our young cavalry officer
is making the tour of the French officers. The
conversation turns on some Count Sazonoff,
&#8220;with whom I was very well acquainted, Monsieur,&#8221;
says a French officer, with one epaulet&#8212;&#8220;he
is one of those real Russian counts, of
whom we are so fond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a Sazonoff with whom I am acquainted,&#8221;
said the cavalry officer, &#8220;but he is
not a count, so far as I know, at least; a little
dark-complexioned man, of about your age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, Monsieur, that is the man. Oh,
how I should like to see that dear count! If
you see him, pray, present my compliments to
him&#8212;Captain Latour,&#8221; says he, bowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn't this a terrible business that we are conducting
here? It was hot work last night, wasn't
it?&#8221; says the cavalry officer, wishing to continue
the conversation, and pointing to the dead bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, frightful, Monsieur! But what brave
fellows your soldiers are&#8212;what brave fellows!
It is a pleasure to fight with such valiant
fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be admitted that your men do not
hang back, either,&#8221; says the cavalry-man, with
a bow, and the conviction that he is very amiable.</p>

<p>But enough of this.</p>

<p>Let us rather observe this lad of ten, clad
in an ancient cap, his father's probably, shoes
worn on bare feet, and nankeen breeches, held
up by a single suspender, who had climbed
over the wall at the very beginning of the
truce, and has been roaming about the ravine,
staring with dull curiosity at the French, and
at the bodies which are lying on the earth,
and plucking the blue wild-flowers with which
the valley is studded. On his way home with
a large bouquet, he held his nose because of the
odor which the wind wafted to him, and paused
beside a pile of corpses, which had been carried
off the field, and stared long at one terrible headless
body, which chanced to be the nearest to him.
After standing there for a long while, he stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
up closer, and touched with his foot the stiffened
arm of the corpse which protruded. The arm
swayed a little. He touched it again, and with
more vigor. The arm swung back, and then fell
into place again. And at once the boy uttered a
shriek, hid his face in the flowers, and ran off to
the fortifications as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>Yes, white flags are hung out from the bastion
and the trenches, the flowery vale is filled with
dead bodies, the splendid sun sinks into the
blue sea, and the blue sea undulates and glitters
in the golden rays of the sun. Thousands of
people congregate, gaze, talk, and smile at each
other. And why do not Christian people, who
profess the one great law of love and self-sacrifice,
when they behold what they have wrought,
fall in repentance upon their knees before Him
who, when he gave them life, implanted in the
soul of each of them, together with a fear of
death, a love of the good and the beautiful, and,
with tears of joy and happiness, embrace each
other like brothers? No! But it is a comfort to
think that it was not we who began this war, that
we are only defending our own country, our father-land.
The white flags have been hauled in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
again the weapons of death and suffering are
shrieking; again innocent blood is shed, and groans
and curses are audible.</p>

<p class="tb">I have now said all that I wish to say at this
time. But a heavy thought overmasters me.
Perhaps it should not have been said; perhaps
what I have said belongs to one of those evil
truths which, unconsciously concealed in the
soul of each man, should not be uttered, lest
they become pernicious, as a cask of wine
should not be shaken, lest it be thereby
spoiled.</p>

<p>Where is the expression of evil which should
be avoided? Where is the expression of good
which should be imitated in this sketch? Who
is the villain, who the hero? All are good, and
all are evil.</p>

<p>Neither Kalugin, with his brilliant bravery&#8212;<i>bravoure
de gentilhomme</i>&#8212;and his vanity, the
instigator of all his deeds; nor Praskukhin, the
empty-headed, harmless man, though he fell in
battle for the faith, the throne, and his native
land; nor Mikhaïloff, with his shyness; nor
Pesth, a child with no firm convictions or principles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
can be either the heroes or the villains
of the tale.</p>

<p>The hero of my tale, whom I love with all
the strength of my soul, whom I have tried
to set forth in all his beauty, and who has
always been, is, and always will be most beautiful,
is&#8212;the truth.</p>

<h2><a name="SEVASTOPOL_IN_AUGUST_1855" id="SEVASTOPOL_IN_AUGUST_1855"></a>SEVASTOPOL IN AUGUST, 1855.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>At the end of August, along the rocky highway
to Sevastopol, between Duvanka and Bakhtchisaraï,
through the thick, hot dust, at a foot-pace,
drove an officer's light cart, that peculiar
<i>telyezhka</i>, not now to be met with, which stands
about half-way between a Jewish <i>britchka</i>, a Russian
travelling-carriage, and a basket-wagon. In
the front of the wagon, holding the reins, squatted
the servant, clad in a nankeen coat and an officer's
cap, which had become quite limp; seated
behind, on bundles and packages covered with a
military coat, was an infantry officer, in a summer
cloak.</p>

<p>As well as could be judged from his sitting position,
the officer was not tall in stature, but extremely
thick, and that not so much from shoulder
to shoulder as from chest to back; he was broad
and thick, and his neck and the base of the head
were excessively developed and swollen. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
waist, so called, a receding strip in the centre of
the body, did not exist in his case; but neither
had he any belly; on the contrary, he was rather
thin than otherwise, particularly in the face, which
was overspread with an unhealthy yellowish sunburn.
His face would have been handsome had it
not been for a certain bloated appearance, and the
soft, yet not elderly, heavy wrinkles that flowed
together and enlarged his features, imparting to
the whole countenance a general expression of
coarseness and of lack of freshness. His eyes
were small, brown, extremely searching, even
bold; his moustache was very thick, but the
ends were kept constantly short by his habit of
gnawing them; and his chin, and his cheek-bones
in particular were covered with a remarkably
strong, thick, and black beard, of two days' growth.</p>

<p>The officer had been wounded on the 10th of
May, by a splinter, in the head, on which he still
wore a bandage, and, having now felt perfectly
well for the last week, he had come out of the
Simferopol Hospital, to rejoin his regiment, which
was stationed somewhere in the direction from
which shots could be heard; but whether that
was in Sevastopol itself, on the northern defences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
or at Inkermann, he had not so far succeeded in
ascertaining with much accuracy from any one.</p>

<p>Shots were still audible near at hand, especially
at intervals, when the hills did not interfere, or
when borne on the wind with great distinctness
and frequency, and apparently near at hand. Then
it seemed as though some explosion shook the air,
and caused an involuntary shudder. Then, one
after the other, followed less resounding reports
in quick succession, like a drum-beat, interrupted
at times by a startling roar. Then, everything
mingled in a sort of reverberating crash, resembling
peals of thunder, when a thunder-storm is
in full force, and the rain has just begun to pour
down in floods, every one said; and it could be
heard that the bombardment was progressing
frightfully.</p>

<p>The officer kept urging on his servant, and
seemed desirous of arriving as speedily as possible.
They were met by a long train of the Russian-peasant
type, which had carried provisions
into Sevastopol, and was now returning with sick
and wounded soldiers in gray coats, sailors in black
paletots, volunteers in red fezes, and bearded militia-men.
The officer's light cart had to halt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the thick, immovable cloud of dust raised by the
carts, and the officer, blinking and frowning with
the dust that stuffed his eyes and ears, gazed at
the faces of the sick and wounded as they passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there's a sick soldier from our company,&#8221;
said the servant, turning to his master,
and pointing to the wagon which was just on a
line with them, full of wounded, at the moment.</p>

<p>On the cart, towards the front, a bearded
Russian, in a lamb's-wool cap, was seated sidewise,
and, holding the stock of his whip under
his elbow, was tying on the lash. Behind him in
the cart, about five soldiers, in different positions,
were shaking about. One, though pale and thin,
with his arm in a bandage, and his cloak thrown
on over his shirt, was sitting up bravely in the
middle of the cart, and tried to touch his cap
on seeing the officer, but immediately afterwards
(recollecting, probably, that he was wounded) he
pretended that he only wanted to scratch his
head. Another, beside him, was lying flat on the
bottom of the wagon; all that was visible was two
hands, as they clung to the rails of the wagon,
and his knees uplifted limp as mops, as they
swayed about in various directions. A third,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
with a swollen face and a bandaged head, on
which was placed his soldier's cap, sat on one side,
with his legs dangling over the wheel, and, with
his elbows resting on his knees, seemed immersed
in thought. It was to him that the passing officer
addressed himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolzhnikoff!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; replied the soldier, opening his eyes,
and pulling off his cap, in such a thick and halting
bass voice that it seemed as though twenty
soldiers had uttered an exclamation at one and
the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;When were you wounded, brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>The leaden and swimming eyes of the soldier
grew animated; he evidently recognized his officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish Your Honor health!&#8221; he began again,
in the same abrupt bass as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the regiment stationed now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was stationed in Sevastopol, but they were
to move on Wednesday, Your Honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know; it must have been to the
Sivernaya, Your Honor! To-day, Your Honor,&#8221;
he added, in a drawling voice, as he put on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
cap, &#8220;they have begun to fire clear across, mostly
with bombs, that even go as far as the bay;
they are fighting horribly to-day, so that&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was impossible to hear what the soldier said
further; but it was evident, from the expression
of his countenance and from his attitude, that he
was uttering discouraging remarks, with the touch
of malice of a man who is suffering.</p>

<p>The travelling officer, Lieutenant Kozeltzoff, was
no common officer. He was not one of those that
live so and so and do thus and so because others
live and do thus; he did whatever he pleased, and
others did the same, and were convinced that it
was well. He was rather richly endowed by nature
with small gifts: he sang well, played on the
guitar, talked very cleverly, and wrote very easily,
particularly official documents, in which he had
practised his hand in his capacity of adjutant of
the battalion; but the most noticeable trait in
his character was his egotistical energy, which,
although chiefly founded on this array of petty
talents, constituted in itself a sharp and striking
trait. His egotism was of the sort that is most
frequently found developed in masculine and especially
in military circles, and which had become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
a part of his life to such a degree that he understood
no other choice than to domineer or to
humiliate himself; and his egotism was the mainspring
even of his private impulses; he liked to
usurp the first place over people with whom he
put himself on a level.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! it's absurd of me to listen to what a
Moskva<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> chatters!&#8221; muttered the lieutenant, experiencing
a certain weight of apathy in his heart,
and a dimness of thought, which the sight of the
transport full of wounded and the words of the
soldier, whose significance was emphasized and
confirmed by the sounds of the bombardment, had
left with him. &#8220;<i>That Moskva is ridiculous!</i>
Drive on, Nikolaeff! go ahead! Are you asleep?&#8221;
he added, rather fretfully, to the servant, as he re-arranged
the skirts of his coat.</p>

<p>The reins were tightened, Nikolaeff clacked his
lips, and the wagon moved on at a trot.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will only halt a minute for food, and will
proceed at once, this very day,&#8221; said the officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>As he entered the street of the ruined remains
of the stone wall, forming the Tatar houses of
Duvanka, Lieutenant Kozeltzoff was stopped by a
transport of bombs and grape-shot, which were on
their way to Sevastopol, and had accumulated on
the road. Two infantry soldiers were seated
in the dust, on the stones of a ruined garden-wall
by the roadside, devouring a watermelon and
bread.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you come far, fellow-countryman?&#8221; said
one of them, as he chewed his bread, to the soldier,
with a small knapsack on his back, who had halted
near them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come from my government to join my
regiment,&#8221; replied the soldier, turning his eyes
away from the watermelon, and readjusting the
sack on his back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> &#8220;There we were, two weeks
ago, at work on the hay, a whole troop of us; but
now they have drafted all of us, and we don't
know where our regiment is at the present time.
They say that our men went on the Korabelnaya
last week. Have you heard anything, gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's stationed in the town, brother,&#8221; said the
second, an old soldier of the reserves, digging
away with his clasp-knife at the white, unripe
melon. &#8220;We have just come from there, this
afternoon. It's terrible, my brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How so, gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you hear how they are firing all around
to-day, so that there is not a whole spot anywhere?
It is impossible to say how many of our
brethren have been killed.&#8221; And the speaker
waved his hand and adjusted his cap.</p>

<p>The passing soldier shook his head thoughtfully,
gave a clack with his tongue, then pulled
his pipe from his boot-leg, and, without filling it,
stirred up the half-burned tobacco, lit a bit of
tinder from the soldier who was smoking, and
raised his cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no one like God, gentlemen! Good-bye,&#8221;
said he, and, with a shake of the sack on his
back, he went his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, there! you'd better wait,&#8221; said the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
who was digging out the watermelon, with an air
of conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes no difference!&#8221; muttered the traveller,
threading his way among the wheels of the
assembled transports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The posting-station was full of people when
Kozeltzoff drove up to it. The first person whom
he encountered, on the porch itself, was a thin and
very young man, the superintendent, who continued
his altercation with two officers, who had followed
him out.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's not three days only, but ten that you will
have to wait. Even generals wait, my good sirs!&#8221;
said the superintendent, with a desire to administer
a prick to the travellers; &#8220;and I am not going
to harness up for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then don't give anybody horses, if there are
none! But why furnish them to some lackey or
other with baggage?&#8221; shouted the elder of the
two officers, with a glass of tea in his hand, and
plainly avoiding the use of pronouns,<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> but giving
it to be understood that he might very easily
address the superintendent as &#8220;<i>thou</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Judge for yourself, now, Mr. Superintendent,&#8221;
said the younger officer, with some hesitation.
&#8220;We don't want to go for our own pleasure. We
must certainly be needed, since we have been
called for. And I certainly shall report to the
general. But this, of course,&#8212;you know that
you are not paying proper respect to the military
profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are always spoiling things,&#8221; the elder
man interrupted, with vexation. &#8220;You only hinder
me; you must know how to talk to them.
Here, now, he has lost his respect. Horses this
very instant, I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be glad to give them to you, <i>bátiushka</i>,<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>
but where am I to get them?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a brief silence, the superintendent began
to grow irritated, and to talk, flourishing his hands
the while.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand, <i>bátiushka</i>. And I know all
about it myself. But what are you going to do?
Only give me&#8221;&#8212;here a ray of hope gleamed
across the faces of the officers&#8212;&#8220;only give me a
chance to live until the end of the month, and you
won't see me here any longer. I'd rather go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the Malakhoff tower, by Heavens! than stay here.
Let them do what they please about it! There's
not a single sound team in the station this day,
and the horses haven't seen a wisp of hay these
three days.&#8221; And the superintendent disappeared
behind the gate.</p>

<p>Kozeltzoff entered the room in company with
the officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the elder officer, quite calmly, to
the younger one, although but a second before he
had appeared to be greatly irritated, &#8220;we have
been travelling these three weeks, and we will
wait a little longer. There's no harm done. We
shall get there at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dirty, smoky apartment was so filled with
officers and trunks that it was with difficulty that
Kozeltzoff found a place near the window, where
he seated himself; he began to roll himself a
cigarette, as he glanced at the faces and lent an
ear to the conversations.</p>

<p>To the right of the door, near a crippled and
greasy table, upon which stood two samovárs,
whose copper had turned green in spots, here and
there, and where sugar was portioned out in
various papers, sat the principal group. A young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
officer, without moustache, in a new, short, wadded
summer coat, was pouring water into the teapot.</p>

<p>Four such young officers were there, in different
corners of the room. One of them had placed a
cloak under his head, and was fast asleep on the
sofa. Another, standing by the table, was cutting
up some roast mutton for an officer without an
arm, who was seated at the table.</p>

<p>Two officers, one in an adjutant's cloak, the
other in an infantry cloak, a thin one however,
and with a satchel strapped over his shoulder,
were sitting near the oven bench, and it was evident,
from the very way in which they stared at
the rest, and from the manner in which the one
with the satchel smoked his cigar, that they were
not line officers on duty at the front, and that
they were delighted at it.</p>

<p>Not that there was any scorn apparent in their
manner, but there was a certain self-satisfied tranquillity,
founded partly on money and partly on
their close intimacy with generals, a certain consciousness
of superiority which even extended to
a desire to hide it.</p>

<p>A thick-lipped young doctor and an officer of
artillery, with a German cast of countenance, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
seated almost on the feet of the young officer who
was sleeping on the sofa, and counting over their
money.</p>

<p>There were four officers' servants, some dozing
and others busy with the trunks and packages
near the door.</p>

<p>Among all these faces, Kozeltzoff did not find
a single familiar one; but he began to listen
with curiosity to the conversation. The young
officers, who, as he decided from their looks
alone, had but just come out of the military academy,
pleased him, and, what was the principal
point, they reminded him that his brother had
also come from the academy, and should have
joined recently one of the batteries of Sevastopol.</p>

<p>But the officer with the satchel, whose face he
had seen before somewhere, seemed bold and
repulsive to him. He even left the window, and,
going to the stove-bench, seated himself on it,
with the thought that he would put the fellow
down if he took it into his head to say anything.
In general, purely as a brave &#8220;line&#8221; officer, he did
not like &#8220;the staff,&#8221; such as he had recognized
these two officers to be at the first glance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&#8220;But this is dreadfully annoying,&#8221; said one of
the young officers, &#8220;to be so near, and yet not be
able to get there. Perhaps there will be an action
this very day, and we shall not be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the sharp voice and the mottled freshness of
the color that swept across the youthful face of
this officer as he spoke there was apparent the
sweet young timidity of the man who is constantly
afraid lest his every word shall not turn
out exactly right.</p>

<p>The one-armed officer glanced at him with a
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will get there soon enough, I assure
you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The young officer looked with respect at the
haggard face of the armless officer, so unexpectedly
illuminated by a smile, held his peace for a
while, and busied himself once more with his tea.
In fact, the one-armed officer's face, his attitude,
and, most of all, the empty sleeve of his coat, expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
much of that tranquil indifference that
may be explained in this way&#8212;that he looked
upon every conversation and every occurrence as
though saying, &#8220;That is all very fine; I know all
about that, and I can do a little of that myself, if
I only choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is our decision to be?&#8221; said the young
officer again to his companion in the short coat.
&#8220;Shall we pass the night here, or shall we proceed
with our own horses?&#8221;</p>

<p>His comrade declined to proceed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just imagine, captain,&#8221; said the one who was
pouring the tea, turning to the one-armed man,
and picking up the knife that the latter had
dropped, &#8220;they told us that horses were frightfully
dear in Sevastopol, so we bought a horse in
partnership at Simferopol.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They made you pay pretty high for it, I
fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, I do not know, captain; we paid
ninety rubles for it and the team. Is that very
dear?&#8221; he added, turning to all the company, and
to Kozeltzoff, who was staring at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not dear, if the horse is young,&#8221; said
Kozeltzoff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Really! but they told us that it was dear.
Only, she limps a little, but that will pass off.
They told us that she was very strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What academy are you from?&#8221; asked Kozeltzoff,
who wished to inquire for his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are just from the academy of the nobility;
there are six of us, and we are on our way to
Sevastopol at our own desire,&#8221; said the talkative
young officer. &#8220;But we do not know where our
battery is; some say that it is in Sevastopol,
others that it is at Odessa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it not possible to find out at Simferopol?&#8221;
asked Kozeltzoff.</p>

<p>&#8220;They do not know there. Just imagine, one
of our comrades went to the headquarters there,
and they were impertinent to him. You can imagine
how disagreeable that was! Would you
like to have me make you a cigarette,&#8221; he said at
that moment to the one-armed officer, who was
just pulling out his cigarette-machine.</p>

<p>He waited on the latter with a sort of servile
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;And are you from Sevastopol also?&#8221; he went
on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> &#8220;Oh, good Heavens, how wonderful that is!
How much we did think of you, and of all our
heroes, in Petersburg,&#8221; he said, turning to Kozeltzoff
with respect and good-natured flattery.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, perhaps, you may have to go back?&#8221;
inquired the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what we are afraid of. You can
imagine that, after having bought the horse, and
provided ourselves with all the necessaries,&#8212;a
coffee-pot with a spirit-lamp, and other indispensable
trifles,&#8212;we have no money left,&#8221; he said,
in a low voice, as he glanced at his companions;
&#8220;so that, if we do have to go back, we don't know
what is to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you received no money for travelling
expenses?&#8221; inquired Kozeltzoff.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied he, in a whisper; &#8220;they only
promised to give it to us here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you the certificate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that&#8212;the principal thing&#8212;is the
certificate; but a senator in Moscow,&#8212;he's my
uncle,&#8212;when I was at his house, said that they
would give it to us here; otherwise, he would have
given me some himself. So they will give it to us
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most certainly they will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I too think that they will,&#8221; he said, in a tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
which showed that, after having made the same
identical inquiry in thirty posting-stations, and
having everywhere received different answers, he
no longer believed any one implicitly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Who ordered beet-soup?&#8221; called out the slatternly
mistress of the house, a fat woman of
forty, as she entered the room with a bowl of
soup.</p>

<p>The conversation ceased at once, and all who
were in the room fixed their eyes on the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it was Kozeltzoff who ordered it,&#8221; said the
young officer. &#8220;He must be waked. Get up for
your dinner,&#8221; he said, approaching the sleeper on
the sofa, and jogging his elbow.</p>

<p>A young lad of seventeen, with merry black eyes
and red cheeks, sprang energetically from the sofa,
and stood in the middle of the room, rubbing
his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, excuse me, please,&#8221; he said to the doctor,
whom he had touched in rising.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Kozeltzoff recognized his brother
immediately, and stepped up to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you know me?&#8221; he said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;A-a-a-!&#8221; exclaimed the younger brother;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> &#8220;this
is astonishing!&#8221; And he began to kiss his
brother.</p>

<p>They kissed twice, but stopped at the third repetition
as though the thought had occurred to
both of them:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is it necessary to do it exactly three
times?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how delighted I am!&#8221; said the elder,
looking at his brother. &#8220;Let us go out on the
porch; we can have a talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, I don't want any soup. You eat
it, Federsohn!&#8221; he said to his comrade.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you wanted something to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't want anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they emerged on the porch, the younger
kept asking his brother: &#8220;Well, how are you; tell
me all about it.&#8221; And still he kept on saying how
glad he was to see him, but he told nothing
himself.</p>

<p>When five minutes had elapsed, during which
time they had succeeded in becoming somewhat
silent, the elder brother inquired why the younger
had not gone into the guards, as they had all
expected him to do.</p>

<p>He wanted to get to Sevastopol as speedily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
as possible, he said; for if things turned out favorably
there, he could get advancement more rapidly
there than in the guards. There it takes ten
years to reach the grade of colonel, while here
Todleben had risen in two years from lieutenant-colonel
to general. Well, and if one did get
killed, there was nothing to be done.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fellow you are!&#8221; said his brother,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the principal thing, do you know,
brother,&#8221; said the younger, smiling and blushing
as though he were preparing to say something
very disgraceful, &#8220;all this is nonsense, and the
principal reason why I asked it was that I was
ashamed to live in Petersburg when men are dying
for their country here. Yes, and I wanted to
be with you,&#8221; he added, with still greater shamefacedness.</p>

<p>&#8220;How absurd you are!&#8221; said the elder brother,
pulling out his cigarette-machine, and not even
glancing at him. &#8220;It's a pity, though, that we
can't be together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, honestly, is it so terrible in the bastions?&#8221;
inquired the younger man, abruptly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is terrible at first, but you get used to it
afterwards. It's nothing. You will see for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And tell me still another thing. What do you
think?&#8212;will Sevastopol be taken? I think that
it will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But one thing is annoying. Just imagine what
bad luck! A whole bundle was stolen from us on
the road, and it had my shako in it, so that now
I am in a dreadful predicament; and I don't know
how I am to show myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger Kozeltzoff, Vladímir, greatly resembled
his brother Mikháïl, but he resembled him as
a budding rose-bush resembles one that is out of
flower. His hair was chestnut also, but it was
thick and lay in curls on his temples. On the
soft white back of his neck there was a blond
lock; a sign of good luck, so the nurses say. The
full-blooded crimson of youth did not stand fixed
on the soft, white hue of his face, but flashed up and
betrayed all the movements of his mind. He had
the same eyes as his brother, but they were more
widely opened, and clearer, which appeared the
more peculiar because they were veiled frequently
by a slight moisture. A golden down was sprouting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
on his cheeks, and over his ruddy lips, which
were often folded into a shy smile, displaying teeth
of dazzling whiteness. He was a well formed and
broad-shouldered fellow, in unbuttoned coat, from
beneath which was visible a red shirt with collar
turned back. As he stood before his brother,
leaning his elbows on the railing of the porch,
with cigarette in hand and innocent joy in his face
and gesture, he was so agreeable and comely a
youth that any one would have gazed at him
with delight. He was extremely pleased with his
brother, he looked at him with respect and pride,
fancying him his hero; but in some ways, so far
as judgments on worldly culture, ability to talk
French, behavior in the society of distinguished
people, dancing, and so on, he was somewhat
ashamed of him, looked down on him, and even
cherished a hope of improving him if such a thing
were possible.</p>

<p>All his impressions, so far, were from Petersburg,
at the house of a lady who was fond of good-looking
young fellows, and who had had him spend
his holidays with her, and from Moscow, at the
house of a senator, where he had once danced at
a great ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Having nearly talked their fill and having
arrived at the feeling that you frequently experience,
that there is little in common between you,
though you love one another, the brothers were
silent for a few moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pick up your things and we will set out at
once,&#8221; said the elder.</p>

<p>The younger suddenly blushed, stammered, and
became confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we to go straight to Sevastopol?&#8221; he
inquired, after a momentary pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes. You can't have many things, and
we can manage to carry them, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good! we will start at once,&#8221; said the
younger, with a sigh, and he went inside.</p>

<p>But he paused in the vestibule without opening
the door, dropped his head gloomily, and began
to reflect.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Straight to Sevastopol, on the instant, within
range of the bombs&#8212;frightful! It's no matter,
however; it must have come sometime. Now, at
all events, with my brother&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact was that it was only now, at the
thought that, once seated in the cart, he should
enter Sevastopol without dismounting from it, and
that no chance occurrence could any longer detain
him, that the danger which he was seeking clearly
presented itself to him, and he was troubled at
the very thought of its nearness. He managed
to control himself in some way, and entered the
room; but a quarter of an hour elapsed, and still
he had not rejoined his brother, so that the latter
opened the door at last, in order to call him. The
younger Kozeltzoff, in the attitude of a naughty
school-boy, was saying something to an officer
named P. When his brother opened the door, he
became utterly confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Immediately. I'll come out in a minute!&#8221; he
cried, waving his hand at his brother. &#8220;Wait for
me there, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later he emerged, in fact, and approached
his brother, with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just imagine! I cannot go with you, brother,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;What? What nonsense is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you the whole truth, Misha! Not
one of us has any money, and we are all in debt
to that staff-captain whom you saw there. It is
horribly mortifying!&#8221;</p>

<p>The elder brother frowned, and did not break
the silence for a long while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you owe much?&#8221; he asked, glancing
askance at his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great deal&#8212;no, not a great deal; but I am
dreadfully ashamed of it. He has paid for me for
three stages, and all his sugar is gone, so that I do
not know&#8212;yes, and we played at preference. I
am a little in his debt there, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is bad, Volodya! Now, what would
you have done if you had not met me?&#8221;
said the elder, sternly, without looking at his
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I was thinking, brother, that I should
get that travelling-money at Sevastopol, and that
I would give him that. Surely, that can be done;
and it will be better for me to go with him to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elder brother pulled out his purse, and, with
fingers that shook a little, he took out two ten-ruble
notes and one for three rubles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;This is all the money I have,&#8221; said he. &#8220;How
much do you owe?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kozeltzoff did not speak the exact truth when
he said that this was all the money he had. He
had, besides, four gold pieces sewn into his cuff,
in case of an emergency; but he had taken a vow
not to touch them.</p>

<p>It appeared that Kozeltzoff, what with preference
and sugar, was in debt to the amount of
eight rubles only. The elder brother gave him
this sum, merely remarking that one should not
play preference when one had no money.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you play for?&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger brother answered not a word. His
brother's question seemed to him to cast a reflection
on his honor. Vexation at himself, a shame
at his conduct, which could give rise to such a
suspicion, and the insult from his brother, of
whom he was so fond, produced upon his sensitive
nature so deeply painful an impression that
he made no reply. Sensible that he was not in
a condition to restrain the sobs which rose in his
throat, he took the money without glancing at it,
and went back to his comrades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Nikolaeff, who had fortified himself at Duvanka,
with two jugs of vodka, purchased from a
soldier who was peddling it on the bridge, gave
the reins a jerk, and the team jolted away over
the stony road, shaded here and there, which led
along the Belbek to Sevastopol; but the brothers,
whose legs jostled each other, maintained a stubborn
silence, although they were thinking of each
other every instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did he insult me?&#8221; thought the younger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
&#8220;Could he not have held his tongue about that?
It is exactly as though he thought that I was a
thief; yes, and now he is angry, apparently, so
that we have quarrelled for good. And how splendid
it would have been for us to be together in
Sevastopol. Two brothers, on friendly terms, both
fighting the foe! one of them, the elder, though
not very cultivated, yet a valiant warrior, and the
other younger, but a brave fellow too. In a
week's time I would have showed them that I
am not such a youngster after all! I shall cease
to blush, there will be manliness in my countenance,
and, though my moustache is not very large
now, it would grow to a good size by that time;&#8221;
and he felt of the down which was making its
appearance round the edges of his mouth. &#8220;Perhaps
we shall arrive to-day, and get directly into
the conflict, my brother and I. He must be obstinate
and very brave, one of those who do not say
much, but act better than others. I should like
to know,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;whether he is squeezing
me against the side of the wagon on purpose or
not. He probably is conscious that I feel awkward,
and he is pretending not to notice me. We
shall arrive to-day,&#8221; he went on with his argument,
pressing close to the side of the wagon, and fearing
to move lest his brother should observe that
he was uncomfortable, &#8220;and, all at once, we shall
go straight to the bastion. We shall both go
together, I with my equipments, and my brother
with his company. All of a sudden, the French
throw themselves on us. I begin to fire, and fire
on them. I kill a terrible number; but they still
continue to run straight at me. Now, it is impossible
to fire any longer, and there is no hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
for me; all at once my brother rushes out in
front with his sword, and I grasp my gun, and
we rush on with the soldiers. The French throw
themselves on my brother. I hasten up; I kill
one Frenchman, then another, and I save my
brother. I am wounded in one arm; I seize my
gun with the other, and continue my flight; but
my brother is slain by my side by the bullets. I
halt for a moment, and gaze at him so sorrowfully;
then I straighten myself up and shout:
&#8216;Follow me! We will avenge him! I loved my
brother more than any one in the world,&#8217; I shall
say, &#8216;and I have lost him. Let us avenge him!
Let us annihilate the foe, or let us all die together
there!&#8217; All shout, and fling themselves after me.
Then the whole French army makes a sortie, including
even Pelissier himself. We all fight; but,
at last, I am wounded a second, a third time, and
I fall, nearly dead. Then, all rush up to me.
Gortchakoff comes up and asks what I would
like. I say that I want nothing&#8212;except that
I may be laid beside my brother; that I wish
to die with him. They carry me, and lay me
down by the side of my brother's bloody corpse.
Then I shall raise myself, and merely say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
&#8216;Yes, you did not understand how to value two
men who really loved their father-land; now they
have both fallen,&#8212;and may God forgive you!&#8217;
and I shall die.</p>

<p>Who knows in what measure these dreams will
be realized?</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever been in a hand to hand
fight?&#8221; he suddenly inquired of his brother,
quite forgetting that he had not meant to speak
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not once,&#8221; answered the elder. &#8220;Our
regiment has lost two thousand men, all on the
works; and I, also, was wounded there. War is
not carried on in the least as you fancy, Volodya.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word &#8220;Volodya&#8221; touched the younger
brother. He wanted to come to an explanation
with his brother, who had not the least idea that
he had offended Volodya.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not angry with me, Misha?&#8221; he said,
after a momentary silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, because&#8212;because we had such a&#8212;nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; replied the elder, turning to
him, and slapping him on the leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Then forgive me, Misha, if I have wounded
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the younger brother turned aside, in order
to hide the tears that suddenly started to his
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Is this Sevastopol already?&#8221; asked the
younger brother, as they ascended the hill.</p>

<p>And before them appeared the bay, with its
masts of ships, its shipping, and the sea, with
the hostile fleet, in the distance; the white batteries
on the shore, the barracks, the aqueducts,
the docks and the buildings of the town,
and the white and lilac clouds of smoke rising
incessantly over the yellow hills, which surrounded
the town and stood out against the blue
sky, in the rosy rays of the sun, which was
reflected by the waves, and sinking towards the
horizon of the shadowy sea.</p>

<p>Volodya, without a shudder, gazed upon this terrible
place of which he had thought so much;
on the contrary, he did so with an æsthetic enjoyment,
and a heroic sense of self-satisfaction at
the idea that here he was&#8212;he would be there
in another half-hour, that he would behold that
really charmingly original spectacle&#8212;and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
stared with concentrated attention from that moment
until they arrived at the north fortification,
at the baggage-train of his brother's regiment,
where they were to ascertain with certainty the
situations of the regiment and the battery.</p>

<p>The officer in charge of the train lived near the
so-called new town (huts built of boards by the
sailors' families), in a tent, connecting with a
tolerably large shed, constructed out of green oak-boughs,
that were not yet entirely withered.</p>

<p>The brothers found the officer seated before a
greasy table, upon which stood a glass of cold tea,
a tray with vodka, crumbs of dry sturgeon roe,
and bread, clad only in a shirt of a dirty yellow
hue, and engaged in counting a huge pile of bank-bills
on a large abacus.</p>

<p>But before describing the personality of the
officer, and his conversation, it is indispensable
that we should inspect with more attention the
interior of his shed, and become a little acquainted,
at least, with his mode of life and his occupations.
The new shed, like those built for generals
and regimental commanders, was large, closely
wattled, and comfortably arranged, with little
tables and benches, made of turf. The sides and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
roof were hung with three rugs, to keep the leaves
from showering down, and, though extremely ugly,
they were new, and certainly costly.</p>

<p>Upon the iron bed, which stood beneath the
principal rug, with a young amazon depicted on
it, lay a plush coverlet, of a brilliant crimson,
a torn and dirty pillow, and a raccoon cloak.
On the table stood a mirror, in a silver frame,
a silver brush, frightfully dirty, a broken horn
comb, full of greasy hair, a silver candlestick,
a bottle of liqueur, with a huge gold and red
label, a gold watch, with a portrait of Peter I.,
two gold pens, a small box, containing pills of
some sort, a crust of bread, and some old, castaway
cards, and there were bottles, both full and
empty, under the bed.</p>

<p>This officer had charge of the commissariat of
the regiment and the fodder of the horses. With
him lived his great friend, the commissioner who
had charge of the operations.</p>

<p>At the moment when the brothers entered,
the latter was asleep in the booth, and the commissary
officer was making up his accounts of the
government money, in anticipation of the end
of the month. The commissary officer had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
very comely and warlike exterior. His stature
was tall, his moustache huge, and he possessed
a respectable amount of plumpness. The only
disagreeable points about him were a certain perspiration
and puffiness of the whole face, which
almost concealed his small gray eyes (as though
he was filled up with porter), and an excessive
lack of cleanliness, from his thin, greasy hair to
his big, bare feet, thrust into some sort of ermine
slippers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money, money!&#8221; said Kozeltzoff number one,
entering the shed, and fixing his eyes, with involuntary
greed, upon the pile of bank-notes. &#8220;You
might lend me half of that, Vasíly Mikhaïlitch!&#8221;</p>

<p>The commissary officer cringed at the sight
of his visitors, and, sweeping up his money, he
bowed to them without rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if it only belonged to me! It's government
money, my dear fellow. And who is
this you have with you?&#8221; said he, thrusting
the money into a coffer which stood beside him,
and staring at Volodya.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is my brother, who has just come from
the military academy. We have both come to
learn from you where our regiment is stationed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, gentlemen,&#8221; said the officer, rising,
and going into the shed, without paying any
heed to his guests. &#8220;Won't you have something
to drink? Some porter, for instance?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't put yourself out, Vasíly Mikhaïlitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Volodya was impressed by the size of the commissary
officer, by his carelessness of manner, and
by the respect with which his brother addressed
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be that this is one of their very fine
officers, whom every one respects. Really, he is
simple, but hospitable and brave,&#8221; he thought,
seating himself in a timid and modest manner on
the sofa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is our regiment stationed, then?&#8221;
called out his elder brother into the board hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>He repeated his query.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zeifer has been here to-day. He told me that
they had removed to the fifth bastion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I say so, it must be true; but the deuce
only knows anyway! He would think nothing of
telling a lie. Won't you have some porter?&#8221; said
the commissary officer, still from the tent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I will if you please,&#8221; said Kozeltzoff.</p>

<p>&#8220;And will you have a drink, Osip Ignatievitch?&#8221;
went on the voice in the tent, apparently
addressing the sleeping commissioner. &#8220;You
have slept enough; it's five o'clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you worry me? I am not asleep,&#8221;
answered a shrill, languid little voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, get up! we find it stupid without you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the commissary officer came out to his
guests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fetch some Simferopol porter!&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>A servant entered the booth, with a haughty
expression of countenance, as it seemed to Volodya,
and, having jostled Volodya, he drew forth
the porter from beneath the bench.</p>

<p>The bottle of porter was soon emptied, and the
conversation had proceeded in the same style for
rather a long time when the flap of the tent flew
open and out stepped a short, fresh-colored man,
in a blue dressing-gown with tassels, in a cap with
a red rim and a cockade. At the moment of his
appearance, he was smoothing his small black
moustache, and, with his gaze fixed on the rugs,
he replied to the greetings of the officer with a
barely perceptible movement of the shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I will drink a small glassful too!&#8221; said he,
seating himself by the table. &#8220;What is this, have
you come from Petersburg, young man?&#8221; he said,
turning courteously to Volodya.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I am on my way to Sevastopol.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you make the application yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What queer tastes you have, gentlemen! I
do not understand it!&#8221; continued the commissioner.
&#8220;It strikes me that I should be ready
just now to travel on foot to Petersburg, if I could
get away. By Heavens, I am tired of this cursed
life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there about it that does not suit
you?&#8221; said the elder Kozeltzoff, turning to him.
&#8220;You're the very last person to complain of life
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>The commissioner cast a look upon him, and
then turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;This danger, these privations, it is impossible
to get anything here,&#8221; he continued, addressing
Volodya.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> &#8220;And why you should take such a
freak, gentlemen, I really cannot understand. If
there were any advantages to be derived from it,
but there is nothing of the sort. It would be a
nice thing, now, wouldn't it, if you, at your age,
were to be left a cripple for life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some need the money, and some serve for
honor's sake!&#8221; said the elder Kozeltzoff, in a tone
of vexation, joining the discussion once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;What's the good of honor, when there's nothing
to eat!&#8221; said the commissioner with a scornful
laugh, turning to the commissary, who also
laughed at this. &#8220;Give us something from
&#8216;Lucia&#8217;; we will listen,&#8221; he said, pointing to the
music-box. &#8220;I love it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, is that Vasíly Mikhaïlitch a fine man?&#8221;
Volodya asked his brother when they emerged, at
dusk, from the booth, and pursued their way to
Sevastopol.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all; but such a niggard that it is a perfect
terror! And I can't bear the sight of that
commissioner, and I shall give him a thrashing
one of these days.&#8221;</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Volodya was not precisely out of sorts when,
nearly at nightfall, they reached the great bridge
over the bay, but he felt a certain heaviness at his
heart. All that he had heard and seen was so
little in consonance with the impressions which
had recently passed away; the huge, light examination
hall, with its polished floor, the kind and
merry voices and laughter of his comrades, the
new uniform, his beloved tsar, whom he had been
accustomed to see for the last seven years, and
who, when he took leave of them, had called them
his children, with tears in his eyes,&#8212;and everything
that he had seen so little resembled his
very beautiful, rainbow-hued, magnificent dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here we are at last!&#8221; said the elder
brother, when they arrived at the Mikhaïlovsky
battery, and dismounted from their cart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> &#8220;If
they let us pass the bridge, we will go directly to
the Nikolaevsky barracks. You stay there until
morning, and I will go to the regiment and find
out where your battery is stationed, and to-morrow
I will come for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why? It would be better if we both
went together,&#8221; said Volodya; &#8220;I will go to the
bastion with you. It won't make any difference;
I shall have to get used to it. If you go, then I
can too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, if you please; I do know, at least,
that....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My advice is, not to go; but if you
choose....&#8221;</p>

<p>The sky was clear and dark; the stars, and the
fires of the bombs in incessant movement and discharges,
were gleaming brilliantly through the
gloom. The large white building of the battery,
and the beginning of the bridge stood out in the
darkness. Literally, every second several discharges
of artillery and explosions, following each
other in quick succession or occurring simultaneously,
shook the air with increasing thunder and
distinctness. Through this roar, and as though repeating
it, the melancholy dash of the waves was
audible. A faint breeze was drawing in from the
sea, and the air was heavy with moisture. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
brothers stepped upon the bridge. A soldier struck
his gun awkwardly against his arm, and shouted:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The orders are not to let any one pass!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of that! We have business! We must
pass!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask the officer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer, who was drowsing as he sat on an
anchor, rose up and gave the order to let them
pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go that way, but not this. Where
are you driving to, all in a heap!&#8221; he cried to the
transport wagons piled high with gabions, which
had clustered about the entrance.</p>

<p>As they descended to the first pontoon, the
brothers encountered soldiers who were coming
thence, and talking loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he has received his ammunition money,
then he has squared his accounts in full&#8212;that's
what it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, brothers!&#8221; said another voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> &#8220;when
you get over on the Severnaya you will see
the world, by heavens! The air is entirely different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may say more!&#8221; said the first speaker.
&#8220;A cursed shell flew in there the other day, and
it tore the legs off of two sailors, so that....&#8221;</p>

<p>The brothers traversed the first pontoon, while
waiting for the wagon, and halted on the second,
which was already flooded with water in parts.
The breeze, which had seemed weak inland, was
very powerful here, and came in gusts; the bridge
swayed to and fro, and the waves, beating noisily
against the beams, and tearing at the cables and
anchors, flooded the planks. At the right the
gloomily hostile sea roared and darkled, as it lay
separated by an interminable level black line from
the starry horizon, which was light gray in its
gleam; lights flashed afar on the enemy's fleet;
on the left towered the black masts of one of our
vessels, and the waves could be heard as they beat
against her hull; a steamer was visible, as it moved
noisily and swiftly from the Severnaya.</p>

<p>The flash of a bomb, as it burst near it, illuminated
for a moment the lofty heaps of gabions
on the deck, two men who were standing on it,
and the white foam and the spurts of greenish
waves, as the steamer ploughed through them.
On the edge of the bridge, with his legs dangling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
in the water, sat a man in his shirt-sleeves, who
was repairing something connected with the
bridge. In front, over Sevastopol, floated the
same fires, and the terrible sounds grew louder
and louder. A wave rolled in from the sea,
flowed over the right side of the bridge, and wet
Volodya's feet; two soldiers passed them, dragging
their feet through the water. Something
suddenly burst with a crash and lighted up the
bridge ahead of them, the wagon driving over it,
and a man on horseback. The splinters fell into
the waves with a hiss, and sent up the water in
splashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mikhaïlo Semyónitch!&#8221; said the rider,
stopping, reining in his horse in front of the
elder Kozeltzoff, &#8220;have you fully recovered already?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you see. Whither is God taking you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Severnaya, for cartridges; I am on my
way to the adjutant of the regiment ... we expect
an assault to-morrow, at any hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where is Martzoff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He lost a leg yesterday; he was in the town,
asleep in his room.... Perhaps you know it?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;The regiment is in the fifth bastion, isn't it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it has taken the place of the M&#8212;&#8212; regiment.
Go to the field-hospital; some of our men
are there, and they will show you the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and are my quarters on the Morskaya
still intact?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my good fellow, they were smashed
to bits long ago by the bombs. You will not
recognize Sevastopol now; there's not a single
woman there now, nor any inns nor music; the
last establishment took its departure yesterday.
It has become horribly dismal there now....
Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the officer rode on his way at a trot.</p>

<p>All at once, Volodya became terribly frightened;
it seemed to him as though a cannon-ball
or a splinter of bomb would fly in their direction,
and strike him directly on the head. This damp
darkness, all these sounds, especially the angry
splashing of the waves, seemed to be saying to
him that he ought not to go any farther, that
nothing good awaited him yonder, that he would
never again set foot on the ground upon this
side of the bay, that he must turn about at once,
and flee somewhere or other, as far as possible
from this terrible haunt of death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> &#8220;But
perhaps it is too late now, everything is settled,&#8221;
thought he, trembling partly at this thought and
partly because the water had soaked through his
boots and wet his feet.</p>

<p>Volodya heaved a deep sigh, and went a little
apart from his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, will they kill me&#8212;me in particular?
Lord, have mercy on me!&#8221; said he, in a whisper,
and he crossed himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Volodya, let us go on!&#8221; said the elder
brother, when their little cart had driven upon
the bridge. &#8220;Did you see that bomb?&#8221;</p>

<p>On the bridge, the brothers met wagons filled
with the wounded, with gabions, and one loaded
with furniture, which was driven by a woman.
On the further side no one detained them.</p>

<p>Clinging instinctively to the walls of the Nikolaevsky
battery, the brothers listened in silence to
the noise of the bombs, exploding overhead, and
to the roar of the fragments, showering down
from above, and came to that spot in the battery
where the image was. There they learned
that the fifth light battery, to which Volodya had
been assigned, was stationed on the Korabelnaya,
and they decided that he should go, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the danger, and pass the night with the elder
in the fifth bastion, and that he should from
there join his battery the next day. They turned
into the corridor, stepping over the legs of the
sleeping soldiers, who were lying all along the
walls of the battery, and at last they arrived at
the place where the wounded were attended to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>As they entered the first room, surrounded
with cots on which lay the wounded, and permeated
with that frightful and disgusting hospital
odor, they met two Sisters of Mercy, who were
coming to meet them.</p>

<p>One woman, of fifty, with black eyes, and a
stern expression of countenance, was carrying
bandages and lint, and was giving strict orders
to a young fellow, an assistant surgeon, who was
following her; the other, a very pretty girl of
twenty, with a pale and delicate little fair face,
gazed in an amiably helpless way from beneath
her white cap, held her hands in the pockets of
her apron, as she walked beside the elder woman,
and seemed to be afraid to quit her side.</p>

<p>Kozeltzoff addressed to them the question
whether they knew where Martzoff was&#8212;the
man whose leg had been torn off on the day
before.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;He belonged to the P&#8212;&#8212; regiment, did he
not?&#8221; inquired the elder. &#8220;Is he a relative of
yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, a comrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show them the way,&#8221; said she, in French, to
the young sister. &#8220;Here, this way,&#8221; and she
approached a wounded man, in company with
the assistant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along; what are you staring at?&#8221; said
Kozeltzoff to Volodya, who, with uplifted eyebrows
and somewhat suffering expression of countenance,
could not tear himself away, but continued
to stare at the wounded. &#8220;Come, let us go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Volodya went off with his brother, still continuing
to gaze about him, however, and repeating unconsciously:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my God! Ah, my God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has probably not been here long?&#8221; inquired
the sister of Kozeltzoff, pointing at
Volodya, who, groaning and sighing, followed
them through the corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has but just arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pretty little sister glanced at Volodya, and
suddenly burst out crying. &#8220;My God! my God!
when will there be an end to all this?&#8221; she said,
with the accents of despair. They entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
officer's hut. Martzoff was lying on his back,
with his muscular arms, bare to the elbow, thrown
over his head, and with the expression on his yellow
face of a man who is clenching his teeth in
order to keep from shrieking with pain. His
whole leg, in its stocking, was thrust outside the
coverlet, and it could be seen how he was twitching
his toes convulsively inside it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how goes it, how do you feel?&#8221; asked
the sister, raising his bald head with her slender,
delicate fingers, on one of which Volodya noticed
a gold ring, and arranging his pillow. &#8220;Here are
some of your comrades come to inquire after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Badly, of course,&#8221; he answered, angrily.
&#8220;Let me alone! it's all right,&#8221;&#8212;the toes in his
stocking moved more rapidly than ever. &#8220;How
do you do? What is your name? Excuse me,&#8221;
he said, turning to Kozeltzoff.... &#8220;Ah, yes, I
beg your pardon! one forgets everything here,&#8221; he
said, when the latter had mentioned his name.
&#8220;You and I lived together,&#8221; he added, without
the slightest expression of pleasure, glancing interrogatively
at Volodya.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is my brother, who has just arrived from
Petersburg to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm! Here I have finished my service,&#8221; he
said, with a frown. &#8220;Ah, how painful it is!...
The best thing would be a speedy end.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew up his leg, and covered his face with
his hands, continuing to move his toes with redoubled
swiftness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must leave him,&#8221; said the sister, in a
whisper, while the tears stood in her eyes; &#8220;he is
in a very bad state.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brothers had already decided on the north
side to go to the fifth bastion; but, on emerging
from the Nikolaevsky battery, they seemed to
have come to a tacit understanding not to subject
themselves to unnecessary danger, and, without
discussing the subject, they determined to go
their ways separately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only, how are you to find your way, Volodya?&#8221;
said the elder. &#8220;However, Nikolaeff will conduct
you to the Korabelnaya, and I will go my way
alone, and will be with you to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing more was said at this last leave-taking
between the brothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>The thunder of the cannon continued with the
same power as before, but Yekaterinskaya street,
along which Volodya walked, followed by the taciturn
Nikolaeff, was quiet and deserted. All that
he could see, through the thick darkness, was the
wide street with the white walls of large houses,
battered in many places, and the stone sidewalk
beneath his feet; now and then, he met soldiers
and officers. As he passed along the left side of
the street, near the Admiralty building, he perceived,
by the light of a bright fire burning behind
the wall, the acacias planted along the sidewalk,
with green guards beneath, and the wretchedly
dusty leaves of these acacias.</p>

<p>He could plainly hear his own steps and those of
Nikolaeff, who followed him, breathing heavily.
He thought of nothing; the pretty little Sister of
Mercy, Martzoff's leg with the toes twitching in
its stocking, the bombs, the darkness, and divers
pictures of death floated hazily through his mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
All his young and sensitive soul shrank together,
and was borne down by his consciousness of loneliness,
and the indifference of every one to his fate
in the midst of danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will kill me, I shall be tortured, I shall
suffer, and no one will weep.&#8221; And all this, instead
of the hero's life, filled with energy and
sympathy, of which he had cherished such glorious
dreams. The bombs burst and shrieked nearer
and ever nearer. Nikolaeff sighed more frequently,
without breaking the silence. On crossing
the bridge leading to the Korabelnaya, he saw
something fly screaming into the bay, not far from
him, which lighted up the lilac waves for an instant
with a crimson glow, then disappeared, and
threw on high a cloud of foam.</p>

<p>&#8220;See there, it was not put out!&#8221; said Nikolaeff,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Volodya, involuntarily, and
quite unexpectedly to himself, in a thin, piping
voice.</p>

<p>They encountered litters with wounded men,
then more regimental transports with gabions;
they met a regiment on Korabelnaya street;
men on horseback passed them. One of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
was an officer, with his Cossack. He was riding at
a trot, but, on catching sight of Volodya, he reined
in his horse near him, looked into his face, turned
and rode on, giving the horse a blow of his whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone, alone; it is nothing to any one whether
I am in existence or not,&#8221; thought the lad, and he
felt seriously inclined to cry.</p>

<p>After ascending the hill, past a high white wall,
he entered a street of small ruined houses, incessantly
illuminated by bombs. A drunken and
dishevelled woman, who was coming out of a small
door in company with a sailor, ran against him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he were only a fine man,&#8221; she grumbled,&#8212;&#8220;Pardon,
Your Honor the officer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor boy's heart sank lower and lower, and
more and more frequently flashed the lightnings
against the dark horizon, and the bombs screamed
and burst about him with ever increasing frequency.
Nikolaeff sighed, and all at once he
began to speak, in what seemed to Volodya a
frightened and constrained tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;What haste we made to get here from home.
It was nothing but travelling. A pretty place to
be in a hurry to get to!&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;What was to be done, if my brother was well
again,&#8221; replied Volodya, in hope that he might
banish by conversation the frightful feeling that
was taking possession of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what sort of health is it when he is thoroughly
ill! Those who are really well had better
stay in the hospital at such a time. A vast deal
of joy there is about it, isn't there? You will
have a leg or an arm torn off, and that's all you
will get! It's not far removed from a downright
sin! And here in the town it's not at all like
the bastion, and that is a perfect terror. You
go and you say your prayers the whole way.
Eh, you beast, there you go whizzing past!&#8221; he
added, directing his attention to the sound of a
splinter of shell whizzing by near them. &#8220;Now,
here,&#8221; Nikolaeff went on, &#8220;I was ordered to show
Your Honor the way. My business, of course, is
to do as I am bid; but the cart has been abandoned
to some wretch of a soldier, and the bundle
is undone.... Go on and on; but if any of the
property disappears, Nikolaeff will have to answer
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After proceeding a few steps further, they came
out on a square. Nikolaeff held his peace, but
sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yonder is your artillery, Your Honor!&#8221; he
suddenly said. &#8220;Ask the sentinel; he will
show you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Volodya, after he had taken a few steps
more, ceased to hear the sound of Nikolaeff's
sighs behind him.</p>

<p>All at once, he felt himself entirely and finally
alone. This consciousness of solitude in danger,
before death, as it seemed to him, lay upon his
heart like a terribly cold and heavy stone.</p>

<p>He halted in the middle of the square, glanced
about him, to see whether he could catch sight of
any one, grasped his head, and uttered his thought
aloud in his terror:&#8212;&#8220;Lord! Can it be that I
am a coward, a vile, disgusting, worthless coward
... can it be that I so lately dreamed of dying
with joy for my father-land, my tsar? No, I
am a wretched, an unfortunate, a wretched being!&#8221;
And Volodya, with a genuine sentiment of despair
and disenchantment with himself, inquired of the
sentinel for the house of the commander of the
battery, and set out in the direction indicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>The residence of the commander of the battery,
which the sentinel had pointed out to him, was a
small, two-story house, with an entrance on the
court-yard. In one of the windows, which was
pasted over with paper, burned the feeble flame
of a candle. A servant was seated on the porch,
smoking his pipe; he went in and announced
Volodya to the commander, and then led him in.
In the room, between the two windows, and beneath
a shattered mirror, stood a table, heaped
with official documents, several chairs, and an iron
bedstead, with a clean pallet, and a small bed-rug
by its side.</p>

<p>Near the door stood a handsome man, with a
large moustache,&#8212;a sergeant, in sabre and cloak,
on the latter of which hung a cross and a Hungarian
medal. Back and forth in the middle of the
room paced a short staff-officer of forty, with
swollen cheeks bound up, and dressed in a thin
old coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I have the honor to report myself, Cornet
Kozeltzoff, 2d, ordered to the fifth light battery,&#8221;
said Volodya, uttering the phrase which he had
learned by heart, as he entered the room.</p>

<p>The commander of the battery responded dryly
to his greeting, and, without offering his hand,
invited him to be seated.</p>

<p>Volodya dropped timidly into a chair, beside the
writing-table, and began to twist in his fingers the
scissors, which his hand happened to light upon.
The commander of the battery put his hands
behind his back, and, dropping his head, pursued
his walk up and down the room, in silence, only
bestowing an occasional glance at the hands which
were twirling the scissors, with the aspect of a
man who is trying to recall something.</p>

<p>The battery commander was a rather stout man,
with a large bald spot on the crown of his head, a
thick moustache, which drooped straight down and
concealed his mouth, and pleasant brown eyes.
His hands were handsome, clean, and plump; his
feet small and well turned, and they stepped out
in a confident and rather dandified manner, proving
that the commander was not a timid man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, coming to a halt in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
sergeant; &#8220;a measure must be added to the grain
to-morrow, or our horses will be getting thin.
What do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, it is possible to do so, Your Excellency!
Oats are very cheap just now,&#8221; replied
the sergeant, twitching his fingers, which he
held on the seams of his trousers, but which
evidently liked to assist in the conversation.
&#8220;Our forage-master, Franchuk, sent me a note
yesterday, from the transports, Your Excellency,
saying that we should certainly be obliged to purchase
oats; they say they are cheap. Therefore,
what are your orders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To buy, of course. He has money, surely.&#8221;
And the commander resumed his tramp through
the room. &#8220;And where are your things?&#8221; he
suddenly inquired of Volodya, as he paused in
front of him.</p>

<p>Poor Volodya was so overwhelmed by the thought
that he was a coward, that he espied scorn for
himself in every glance, in every word, as though
they had been addressed to a pitiable poltroon.
It seemed to him that the commander of the battery
had already divined his secret, and was making
sport of him. He answered, with embarrassment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
that his effects were on the Grafskaya, and
that his brother had promised to send them to
him on the morrow.</p>

<p>But the lieutenant-colonel was not listening to
him, and, turning to the sergeant, he inquired:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we to put the ensign?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The ensign, sir?&#8221; said the sergeant, throwing
Volodya into still greater confusion by the fleeting
glance which he cast upon him, and which seemed
to say, &#8220;What sort of an ensign is this?&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;He
can be quartered downstairs, with the staff-captain,
Your Excellency,&#8221; he continued, after a little
reflection. &#8220;The captain is at the bastion just
now, and his cot is empty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will that not suit you, temporarily?&#8221; said the
commander.&#8212;&#8220;I think you must be tired, but we
will lodge you better to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Volodya rose and bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you not have some tea?&#8221; said the commander,
when he had already reached the door.
&#8220;The samovár can be brought in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Volodya saluted and left the room. The lieutenant-colonel's
servant conducted him downstairs,
and led him into a bare, dirty chamber, in which
various sorts of rubbish were lying about, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
where there was an iron bedstead without either
sheets or coverlet. A man in a red shirt was fast
asleep on the bed, covered over with a thick cloak.</p>

<p>Volodya took him for a soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Piotr Nikolaïtch!&#8221; said the servant, touching
the sleeper on the shoulder. &#8220;The ensign is to
sleep here.... This is our yunker,&#8221; he added,
turning to the ensign.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, don't trouble him, please,&#8221; said Volodya;
but the yunker, a tall, stout, young man, with a
handsome but very stupid face, rose from the bed,
threw on his cloak, and, evidently not having had
a good sleep, left the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter; I'll lie down in the yard,&#8221; he
growled out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>Left alone with his own thoughts, Volodya's
first sensation was a fear of the incoherent, forlorn
state of his own soul. He wanted to go to
sleep, and forget all his surroundings, and himself
most of all. He extinguished the candle, lay
down on the bed, and, taking off his coat, he
wrapped his head up in it, in order to relieve his
terror of the darkness, with which he had been
afflicted since his childhood. But all at once the
thought occurred to him that a bomb might come
and crush in the roof and kill him. He began to
listen attentively; directly overhead, he heard the
footsteps of the battery commander.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, if it does come,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;it will
kill any one who is upstairs first, and then me; at
all events, I shall not be the only one.&#8221;</p>

<p>This thought calmed him somewhat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and what if Sevastopol should be taken
unexpectedly, in the night, and the French make
their way hither? What am I to defend myself
with?&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose once more, and began to pace the
room. His terror of the actual danger outweighed
his secret fear of the darkness. There
was nothing heavy in the room except the samovár
and a saddle. &#8220;I am a scoundrel, a coward,
a miserable coward!&#8221; the thought suddenly
occurred to him, and again he experienced that
oppressive sensation of scorn and disgust, even
for himself. Again he threw himself on the
bed, and tried not to think.</p>

<p>Then the impressions of the day involuntarily
penetrated his imagination, in consequence of the
unceasing sounds, which made the glass in the
solitary window rattle, and again the thought of
danger recurred to him: now he saw visions of
wounded men and blood, now of bombs and splinters,
flying into the room, then of the pretty little
Sister of Mercy, who was applying a bandage to
him, a dying man, and weeping over him, then of
his mother, accompanying him to the provincial
town, and praying, amid burning tears, before the
wonder-working images, and once more sleep appeared
an impossibility to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>But suddenly the thought of Almighty God,
who can do all things, and who hears every supplication,
came clearly into his mind. He knelt
down, crossed himself, and folded his hands as
he had been taught to do in his childhood, when
he prayed. This gesture, all at once, brought
back to him a consoling feeling, which he had
long since forgotten.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I must die, if I must cease to exist, &#8216;thy
will be done, Lord,&#8217;&#8221; he thought; &#8220;let it be
quickly; but if bravery is needed, and the firmness
which I do not possess, give them to me;
deliver me from shame and disgrace, which I cannot
bear, but teach me what to do in order to
fulfil thy will.&#8221;</p>

<p>His childish, frightened, narrow soul was suddenly
encouraged; it cleared up, and caught sight
of broad, brilliant, and new horizons. During the
brief period while this feeling lasted, he felt and
thought many other things, and soon fell asleep
quietly and unconcernedly, to the continuous
sounds of the roar of the bombardment and the
rattling of the window-panes.</p>

<p>Great Lord! thou alone hast heard, and thou
alone knowest those ardent, despairing prayers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
ignorance, of troubled repentance, those petitions
for the healing of the body and the enlightenment
of the mind, which have ascended to thee from
that terrible precinct of death, from the general
who, a moment before, was thinking of his cross
of the George on his neck, and conscious in his
terror of thy near presence, to the simple soldier
writhing on the bare earth of the Nikolaevsky battery,
and beseeching thee to bestow upon him
there the reward, unconsciously presaged, for all
his sufferings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>


<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>The elder Kozeltzoff, meeting on the street a
soldier belonging to his regiment, betook himself
at once, in company with the man, to the fifth
bastion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep under the wall, Your Honor,&#8221; said the
soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's dangerous, Your Honor; there's one passing
over,&#8221; said the soldier, listening to the sound
of a screaming cannon-ball, which struck the dry
road, on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>Kozeltzoff, paying no heed to the soldier, walked
bravely along the middle of the street.</p>

<p>These were the same streets, the same fires,
even more frequent now, the sounds, the groans,
the encounters with the wounded, and the same
batteries, breastworks, and trenches, which had
been there in the spring, when he was last in
Sevastopol; but, for some reason, all this was now
more melancholy, and, at the same time, more energetic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the apertures in the houses were larger,
there were no longer any lights in the windows,
with the exception of the Kushtchin house (the
hospital), not a woman was to be met with, the
earlier tone of custom and freedom from care no
longer rested over all, but, instead, a certain impress
of heavy expectation, of weariness and earnestness.</p>

<p>But here is the last trench already, and here is the
voice of a soldier of the P&#8212;&#8212; regiment, who has
recognized the former commander of his company,
and here stands the third battalion in the gloom,
clinging close to the wall, and lighted up now and
then, for a moment, by the discharges, and a sound
of subdued conversation, and the rattling of guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the commander of the regiment?&#8221;
inquired Kozeltzoff.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the bomb-proofs with the sailors, Your
Honor,&#8221; replied the soldier, ready to be of service.
&#8220;I will show you the way, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>From trench to trench the soldier led Kozeltzoff,
to the small ditch in the trench. In the
ditch sat a sailor, smoking his pipe; behind him
a door was visible, through whose cracks shone a
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Can I enter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will announce you at once,&#8221; and the sailor
went in through the door.</p>

<p>Two voices became audible on the other side of
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Prussia continues to observe neutrality,&#8221;
said one voice, &#8220;then Austria also....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What difference does Austria make,&#8221; said the
second, &#8220;when the Slavic lands ... well, ask
him to come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kozeltzoff had never been in this casemate.
He was struck by its elegance. The floor was of
polished wood, screens shielded the door. Two
bedsteads stood against the wall, in one corner
stood a large ikon of the mother of God, in a gilt
frame, and before her burned a rose-colored lamp.</p>

<p>On one of the beds, a naval officer, fully
dressed, was sleeping. On the other, by a table
upon which stood two bottles of wine, partly
empty, sat the men who were talking&#8212;the new
regimental commander and his adjutant.</p>

<p>Although Kozeltzoff was far from being a coward,
and was certainly not guilty of any wrongdoing
so far as his superior officers were concerned,
nor towards the regimental commander,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
yet he felt timid before the colonel, who had
been his comrade not long before, so proudly did
this colonel rise and listen to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is strange,&#8221; thought Kozeltzoff, as he surveyed
his commander, &#8220;it is only seven weeks
since he took the regiment, and how visible
already is his power as regimental commander, in
everything about him&#8212;in his dress, his bearing,
his look. Is it so very long,&#8221; thought he, &#8220;since
this Batrishtcheff used to carouse with us, and he
wore a cheap cotton shirt, and ate by himself,
never inviting any one to his quarters, his eternal
meat-balls and curd-patties? But now! and that
expression of cold pride in his eyes, which says
to you, &#8216;Though I am your comrade, because I am
a regimental commander of the new school, yet,
believe me, I am well aware that you would give
half your life merely for the sake of being in my
place!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been a long time in recovering,&#8221; said
the colonel to Kozeltzoff, coldly, with a stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was ill, colonel! The wound has not closed
well even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there was no use in your coming,&#8221; said
the colonel, casting an incredulous glance at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
captain's stout figure. &#8220;You are, nevertheless,
in a condition to fulfil your duty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I am, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well I'm very glad of that, sir. You will take
the ninth company from Ensign Zaitzoff&#8212;the one
you had before; you will receive your orders
immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I obey, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care to send me the regimental adjutant
when you arrive,&#8221; said the regimental commander,
giving him to understand, by a slight nod, that his
audience was at an end.</p>

<p>On emerging from the casemate, Kozeltzoff
muttered something several times, and shrugged
his shoulders, as though pained, embarrassed, or
vexed at something, and vexed, not at the regimental
commander (there was no cause for that),
but at himself, and he appeared to be dissatisfied
with himself and with everything about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>


<h3>XV.</h3>

<p>Before going to his officers, Kozeltzoff went to
greet his company, and to see where it was stationed.</p>

<p>The breastwork of gabions, the shapes of the
trenches, the cannons which he passed, even
the fragments of shot, bombs, over which he
stumbled in his path&#8212;all this, incessantly illuminated
by the light of the firing, was well known
to him, all this had engraved itself in vivid colors
on his memory, three months before, during
the two weeks which he had spent in this very
bastion, without once leaving it. Although there
was much that was terrible in these reminiscences,
a certain charm of past things was mingled with it,
and he recognized the familiar places and objects
with pleasure, as though the two weeks spent
there had been agreeable ones. The company
was stationed along the defensive wall toward
the sixth bastion.</p>

<p>Kozeltzoff entered the long casemate, utterly unprotected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
at the entrance side, in which they had
told him that the ninth company was stationed.
There was, literally, no room to set his foot in the
casemate, so filled was it, from the very entrance,
with soldiers. On one side burned a crooked tallow
candle, which a recumbent soldier was holding
to illuminate the book which another one was
spelling out slowly. Around the candle, in the
reeking half-light, heads were visible, eagerly
raised in strained attention to the reader. The
little book in question was a primer. As Kozeltzoff
entered the casemate, he heard the following:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray-er af-ter lear-ning. I thank Thee,
Crea-tor ...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snuff that candle!&#8221; said a voice. &#8220;That's a
splendid book.&#8221; &#8220;My ... God ...&#8221; went on
the reader.</p>

<p>When Kozeltzoff asked for the sergeant, the
reader stopped, the soldiers began to move about,
coughed, and blew their noses, as they always do
after enforced silence. The sergeant rose near
the group about the reader, buttoning up his
coat as he did so, and stepping over and on the
feet of those who had no room to withdraw them,
and came forward to his officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, brother? Do all these belong
to our company?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you health! Welcome on your return,
Your Honor!&#8221; replied the sergeant, with a cheerful
and friendly look at Kozeltzoff. &#8220;Has Your
Honor recovered your health? Well, God be
praised. It has been very dull for us without
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was immediately apparent that Kozeltzoff
was beloved in the company.</p>

<p>In the depths of the casemate, voices could
be heard. Their old commander, who had been
wounded, Mikhaïl Semyónitch Kozeltzoff, had arrived,
and so forth; some even approached, and
the drummer congratulated him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Obantchuk?&#8221; said Kozeltzoff.
&#8220;Are you all right? Good-day, children!&#8221; he
said, raising his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;We wish you health!&#8221; sounded through the
casemate.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you getting on, children?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Badly, Your Honor. The French are getting
the better of us.&#8212;Fighting from behind the fortifications
is bad work, and that's all there is about
it! and they won't come out into the open field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps luck is with me, and God will grant
that they shall come out into the field, children!&#8221;
said Kozeltzoff. &#8220;It won't be the first time that
you and I have taken a hand together: we'll beat
them again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We'll be glad to try it, Your Honor!&#8221; exclaimed
several voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how about them&#8212;are they really bold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frightfully bold!&#8221; said the drummer, not
loudly, but so that his words were audible, turning
to another soldier, as though justifying before him
the words of the commander, and persuading him
that there was nothing boastful or improbable in
these words.</p>

<p>From the soldiers, Kozeltzoff proceeded to the
defensive barracks and his brother officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>


<h3>XVI.</h3>

<p>In the large room of the barracks there was a
great number of men; naval, artillery, and infantry
officers. Some were sleeping, others were
conversing, seated on the shot-chests and gun-carriages
of the cannons of the fortifications;
others still, who formed a very numerous and
noisy group behind the arch, were seated upon two
felt rugs, which had been spread on the floor, and
were drinking porter and playing cards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Kozeltzoff, Kozeltzoff! Capital! it's a
good thing that he has come! He's a brave fellow!...
How's your wound?&#8221; rang out from
various quarters. Here also it was evident that
they loved him and were rejoiced at his coming.</p>

<p>After shaking hands with his friends, Kozeltzoff
joined the noisy group of officers engaged in playing
cards. There were some of his acquaintances
among them. A slender, handsome, dark-complexioned
man, with a long, sharp nose and a huge
moustache, which began on his cheeks, was dealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the cards with his thin, white, taper fingers,
on one of which there was a heavy gold seal ring.
He was dealing straight on, and carelessly, being
evidently excited by something,&#8212;and merely desirous
of making a show of heedlessness. On his
right, and beside him, lay a gray-haired major,
supporting himself on his elbow, and playing for
half a ruble with affected coolness, and settling
up immediately. On his left squatted an officer
with a red, perspiring face, who was laughing and
jesting in a constrained way. When his cards
won, he moved one hand about incessantly in his
empty trousers pocket. He was playing high, and
evidently no longer for ready money, which displeased
the handsome, dark-complexioned man.
A thin and pallid officer with a bald head, and a
huge nose and mouth, was walking about the
room, holding a large package of bank-notes in
his hand, staking ready money on the bank, and
winning.</p>

<p>Kozeltzoff took a drink of vodka, and sat down
by the players.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a hand, Mikhaïl Semyónitch!&#8221; said the
dealer to him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> &#8220;you have brought lots of money,
I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where should I get any money! On the contrary,
I got rid of the last I had in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea! Some one certainly must have
fleeced you in Simpferopol.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really have but very little,&#8221; said Kozeltzoff,
but he was evidently desirous that they should
not believe him; then he unbuttoned his coat,
and took the old cards in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't care if I do try; there's no knowing
what the Evil One will do! queer things do come
about at times. But I must have a drink, to get
up my courage.&#8221;</p>

<p>And within a very short space of time he had
drunk another glass of vodka and several of porter,
and had lost his last three rubles.</p>

<p>A hundred and fifty rubles were written down
against the little, perspiring officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he will not bring them,&#8221; said he, carelessly,
drawing a fresh card.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try to send it,&#8221; said the dealer to him, pausing
a moment in his occupation of laying out the
cards, and glancing at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to send it to-morrow,&#8221; repeated the
perspiring officer, rising, and moving his hand
about vigorously in his empty pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Hm!&#8221; growled the dealer, and, throwing the
cards angrily to the right and left, he completed
the deal. &#8220;But this won't do,&#8221; said he, when he
had dealt the cards. &#8220;I'm going to stop. It
won't do, Zakhár Ivánitch,&#8221; he added, &#8220;we have
been playing for ready money and not on credit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, do you doubt me? That's strange,
truly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From whom is one to get anything?&#8221; muttered
the major, who had won about eight rubles.
&#8220;I have lost over twenty rubles, but when I have
won&#8212;I get nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How am I to pay,&#8221; said the dealer, &#8220;when
there is no money on the table?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won't listen to you!&#8221; shouted the major,
jumping up, &#8220;I am playing with you, but not with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>All at once the perspiring officer flew into a
rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you that I will pay to-morrow; how dare
you say such impertinent things to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall say what I please! This is not the
way to do&#8212;that's the truth!&#8221; shouted the major.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do, Feódor Feodoritch!&#8221; all chimed
in, holding back the major.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>But let us draw a veil over this scene. To-morrow,
to-day, it may be, each one of these men
will go cheerfully and proudly to meet his death,
and he will die with firmness and composure; but
the one consolation of life in these conditions,
which terrify even the coldest imagination in the
absence of all that is human, and the hopelessness
of any escape from them, the one consolation is
forgetfulness, the annihilation of consciousness.
At the bottom of the soul of each lies that
noble spark, which makes of him a hero; but
this spark wearies of burning clearly&#8212;when the
fateful moment comes it flashes up into a flame,
and illuminates great deeds.</p>

<h3>XVII.</h3>

<p>On the following day, the bombardment proceeded
with the same vigor. At eleven o'clock in
the morning, Volodya Kozeltzoff was seated in a
circle of battery officers, and, having already succeeded
to some extent in habituating himself to
them, he was surveying the new faces, taking observations,
making inquiries, and telling stories.</p>

<p>The discreet conversation of the artillery officers,
which made some pretensions to learning,
pleased him and inspired him with respect. Volodya's
shy, innocent, and handsome appearance disposed
the officers in his favor.</p>

<p>The eldest officer in the battery, the captain, a
short, sandy-complexioned man, with his hair arranged
in a topknot, and smooth on the temples,
educated in the old traditions of the artillery, a
squire of dames, and a would-be learned man,
questioned Volodya as to his acquirements in
artillery and new inventions, jested caressingly
over his youth and his pretty little face, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
treated him, in general, as a father treats a son,
which was extremely agreeable to Volodya.</p>

<p>Sub-Lieutenant Dyadenko, a young officer,
who talked with a Little Russian accent, had a
tattered cloak and dishevelled hair, although he
talked very loudly, and constantly seized opportunities
to dispute acrimoniously over some
topic, and was very abrupt in his movements,
pleased Volodya, who, beneath this rough exterior,
could not help detecting in him a very fine
and extremely good man. Dyadenko was incessantly
offering his services to Volodya, and pointing
out to him that not one of the guns in
Sevastopol was properly placed, according to rule.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tchernovitzky, with his brows elevated
on high, though he was more courteous than
any of the rest, and dressed in a coat that was
tolerably clean, but not new, and carefully patched,
and though he displayed a gold watch-chain on a
satin waistcoat, did not please Volodya. He kept
inquiring what the Emperor and the minister of
war were doing, and related to him, with unnatural
triumph, the deeds of valor which had been
performed in Sevastopol, complained of the small
number of true patriots, and displayed a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
deal of learning, and sense, and noble feeling in
general; but, for some reason, all this seemed unpleasant
and unnatural to Volodya. The principal
thing which he noticed was that the other officers
hardly spoke to Tchernovitzky.</p>

<p>Yunker Vlang, whom he had waked up on the
preceding evening, was also there. He said nothing,
but, seated modestly in a corner, laughed
when anything amusing occurred, refreshed their
memories when they forgot anything, handed the
vodka, and made cigarettes for all the officers.
Whether it was the modest, courteous manners of
Volodya, who treated him exactly as he did the
officers, and did not torment him as though he
were a little boy, or his agreeable personal appearance
which captivated Vlang<i>a</i>, as the soldiers
called him, declining his name, for some reason
or other, in the feminine gender, at all events, he
never took his big, kind eyes from the face of the
new officer. He divined and anticipated all his
wishes, and remained uninterruptedly in a sort of
lover-like ecstasy, which, of course, the officers
perceived, and made fun of.</p>

<p>Before dinner, the staff-captain was relieved from
the battery, and joined their company. Staff-Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Kraut was a light-complexioned, handsome,
dashing officer, with a heavy, reddish moustache,
and side-whiskers; he spoke Russian capitally,
but too elegantly and correctly for a Russian. In
the service and in his life, he had been the same
as in his language; he served very well, was a
capital comrade, and the most faithful of men in
money matters; but simply as a man something
was lacking in him, precisely because everything
about him was so excellent. Like all Russian-Germans,
by a strange contradiction with the ideal
German, he was &#8220;praktisch&#8221; to the highest degree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he is, our hero makes his appearance!&#8221;
said the captain, as Kraut, flourishing his arms and
jingling his spurs, entered the room. &#8220;Which
will you have, Friedrich Krestyanitch, tea or
vodka?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already ordered my tea to be served,&#8221;
he answered, &#8220;but I may take a little drop of
vodka also, for the refreshing of the soul. Very
glad to make your acquaintance; I beg that you
will love us, and lend us your favor,&#8221; he said to
Volodya, who rose and bowed to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> &#8220;Staff-Captain
Kraut.... The gun-sergeant on the
bastion informed me that you arrived last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged for your bed; I passed the
night in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you found it comfortable? One of the
legs is broken; but no one can stand on ceremony&#8212;in
time of siege&#8212;you must prop it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, did you have a fortunate time on
your watch?&#8221; asked Dyadenko.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, all right; only Skvortzoff was hit, and
we mended one of the gun-carriages last night.
The cheek was smashed to atoms.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose from his seat, and began to walk up
and down; it was plain that he was wholly under
the influence of that agreeable sensation which a
man experiences who has just escaped a danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Dmitri Gavrilitch,&#8221; he said, tapping the
captain on the knee, &#8220;how are you getting on, my
dear fellow? How about your promotion?&#8212;no
word yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and there will be nothing,&#8221; interpolated
Dyadenko: &#8220;I proved that to you before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why won't there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the story was not properly written
down.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you quarrelsome fellow, you quarrelsome
fellow!&#8221; said Kraut, smiling gayly; &#8220;a regular
obstinate Little Russian! Now, just to provoke
you, he'll turn out your lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he won't.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vlang! fetch me my pipe, and fill it,&#8221; said he,
turning to the yunker, who at once hastened up
obligingly with the pipe.</p>

<p>Kraut made them all lively; he told about the
bombardment, he inquired what had been going
on in his absence, and entered into conversation
with every one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>


<h3>XVIII.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Well, how are things? Have you already
got settled among us?&#8221; Kraut asked Volodya....
&#8220;Excuse me, what is your name and patronymic?
that's the custom with us in the artillery,
you know. Have you got hold of a saddle-horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Volodya; &#8220;I do not know what to
do. I told the captain that I had no horse, and
no money, either, until I get some for forage and
travelling expenses. I want to ask the battery
commander for a horse in the meantime, but I am
afraid that he will refuse me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apollon Sergiéitch, do you mean?&#8221; he produced
with his lips a sound indicative of the
strongest doubt, and glanced at the captain; &#8220;not
likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What's that? If he does refuse, there'll be
no harm done,&#8221; said the captain. &#8220;There are
horses, to tell the truth, which are not needed,
but still one might try; I will inquire to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Don't you know him?&#8221; Dyadenko interpolated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
&#8220;He might refuse anything, but there
is no reason for refusing this. Do you want to
bet on it?...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course, everybody knows already that
you always contradict.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I contradict because I know. He is niggardly
about other things, but he will give the horse
because it is no advantage to him to refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No advantage, indeed, when it costs him eight
rubles here for oats!&#8221; said Kraut. &#8220;Is there no
advantage in not keeping an extra horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask Skvoretz yourself, Vladímir Semyónitch!&#8221;
said Vlang, returning with Kraut's pipe. &#8220;It's a
capital horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one you tumbled into the ditch with, on
the festival of the forty martyrs, in March? Hey!
Vlang?&#8221; remarked the staff-captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and why should you say that it costs eight
rubles for oats,&#8221; pursued Dyadenko, &#8220;when his
own inquiries show him that it is ten and a half;
of course, he has no object in it.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just as though he would have nothing left!
So when you get to be battery commander, you
won't let any horses go into the town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I get to be battery commander, my
dear fellow, my horses will get four measures of
oats to eat, and I shall not accumulate an income,
never fear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we live, we shall see,&#8221; said the staff-captain;
&#8220;and you will act just so, and so will he
when he commands a battery,&#8221; he added, pointing
at Volodya.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you think, Friedrich Krestyanitch,
that he would turn it to his profit?&#8221; broke in
Tchernovitzky. &#8220;Perhaps he has property of his
own; then why should he turn it to profit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, I ... excuse me, captain,&#8221; said
Volodya, reddening up to his ears, &#8220;that strikes
me as insulting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh ho, ho! What a madcap he is!&#8221; said
Kraut.</p>

<p>&#8220;That has nothing to do with it; I only think
that if the money were not mine, I should not
take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I'll tell you something right here, young
man,&#8221; began the staff-captain in a more serious
tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> &#8220;you are to understand that when you command
a battery, if you manage things well, that's
sufficient; the commander of a battery does not
meddle with provisioning the soldiers; that is the
way it has been from time immemorial in the artillery.
If you are a bad manager, you will have
nothing left. Now, these are the expenditures in
conformity with your position: for shoeing your
horse,&#8212;one (he closed one finger); for the apothecary,&#8212;two
(he closed another finger); for office
work,&#8212;three (he shut a third); for extra horses,
which cost five hundred rubles, my dear fellow,&#8212;that's
four; you must change the soldiers' collars,
you will use a great deal of coal, you must keep
open table for your officers. If you are a battery-commander,
you must live decently; you need a
carriage, and a fur coat, and this thing and that
thing, and a dozen more ... but what's the use
of enumerating them all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is the principal thing, Vladímir Semyónitch,&#8221;
interpolated the captain, who had held
his peace all this time; &#8220;imagine yourself to be a
man who, like myself, for instance, has served
twenty years, first for two hundred, then for
three hundred rubles pay; why should he not
be given at least a bit of bread, against his old
age?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh! yes, there you have it!&#8221; spoke up the
staff-captain again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> &#8220;don't be in a hurry to pronounce
judgment, but live on and serve your
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Volodya was horribly ashamed and sorry for
having spoken so thoughtlessly, and he muttered
something and continued to listen in silence,
when Dyadenko undertook, with the greatest zeal,
to dispute it and to prove the contrary.</p>

<p>The dispute was interrupted by the arrival of
the colonel's servant, who summoned them to
dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Apollon Sergiéitch that he must give us
some wine to-day,&#8221; said Tchernovitzky, to the
captain, as he buttoned up his uniform.&#8212;&#8220;Why
is he so stingy with it? He will be killed, and no
one will get the good of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. You are my superior officer.
Rank must be regarded in all things.&#8221;</p>


<h3>XIX.</h3>

<p>The table had been moved out from the wall,
and spread with a soiled table-cloth, in the same
room in which Volodya had presented himself to
the colonel on the preceding evening. The battery
commander now offered him his hand, and
questioned him about Petersburg and his journey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen, I beg the favor of a glass
with any of you who drink vodka. The ensigns
do not drink,&#8221; he added, with a smile.</p>

<p>On the whole, the battery commander did not
appear nearly so stern to-day as he had on the
preceding evening; on the contrary, he had the
appearance of a kindly, hospitable host, and an
elder comrade among the officers. But, in spite
of this, all the officers, from the old captain down
to Ensign Dyadenko, by their very manner of
speaking and looking the commander straight in
the eye, as they approached, one after the other,
to drink their vodka, exhibited great respect for
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>The dinner consisted of a large wooden bowl of
cabbage-soup, in which floated fat chunks of beef,
and a huge quantity of pepper and laurel-leaves,
mustard, and Polish meat-balls in a cabbage leaf,
turnover patties of chopped meat and dough, and
with butter, which was not perfectly fresh. There
were no napkins, the spoons were of pewter and
wood, there were only two glasses, and on the table
stood a decanter of water with a broken neck;
but the dinner was not dull; conversation never
halted.</p>

<p>At first, their talk turned on the battle of
Inkerman, in which the battery had taken part,
as to the causes of failure, of which each one gave
his own impressions and ideas, and held his tongue
as soon as the battery commander himself began
to speak; then the conversation naturally changed
to the insufficiency of calibre of the light guns,
and upon the new lightened cannons, in which
connection Volodya had an opportunity to display
his knowledge of artillery.</p>

<p>But their talk did not dwell upon the present
terrible position of Sevastopol, as though each
of them had meditated too much on that subject
to allude to it again. In the same way, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Volodya's great amazement and disappointment,
not a word was said about the duties of the service
which he was to fulfil, just as though he
had come to Sevastopol merely for the purpose
of telling about the new cannon and dining with
the commander of the battery.</p>

<p>While they were at dinner, a bomb fell not far
from the house in which they were seated. The
walls and the floor trembled, as though in an
earthquake, and the window was obscured with
the smoke of the powder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not see anything of this sort in Petersburg,
I fancy; but these surprises often take
place here,&#8221; said the battery commander.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Vlang, and see where it burst.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vlang looked, and reported that it had burst on
the square, and then there was nothing more said
about the bomb.</p>

<p>Just before the end of the dinner, an old man,
the clerk of the battery, entered the room, with
three sealed envelopes, and handed them to the
commander.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is very important; a messenger has this
moment brought these from the chief of the
artillery.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the officers gazed, with impatient curiosity,
at the commander's practised fingers as they
broke the seal of the envelope and drew forth the
<i>very important</i> paper. &#8220;What can it be?&#8221; each
one asked himself.</p>

<p>It might be that they were to march out of Sevastopol
for a rest, it might be an order for the
whole battery to betake themselves to the bastions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again!&#8221; said the commander, flinging the
paper angrily on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;What's it about, Apollon Sergiéitch?&#8221; inquired
the eldest officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;An officer and crew are required for a mortar
battery over yonder, and I have only four officers,
and there is not a full gun-crew in the line,&#8221;
growled the commander: &#8220;and here more are
demanded of me. But some one must go, gentlemen,&#8221;
he said, after a brief pause: &#8220;the order requires
him to be at the barrier at seven o'clock....
Send the sergeant! Who is to go, gentlemen?
decide,&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here's one who has never been yet,&#8221;
said Tchernovitzky, pointing to Volodya. The
commander of the battery made no reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I should like to go,&#8221; said Volodya, as
he felt the cold sweat start out on his back and
neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; why should you? There's no occasion!&#8221;
broke in the captain. &#8220;Of course, no one will
refuse, but neither is it proper to ask any one;
but if Apollon Sergiéitch will permit us, we will
draw lots, as we did once before.&#8221;</p>

<p>All agreed to this. Kraut cut some paper into
bits, folded them up, and dropped them into a
cap. The captain jested, and even plucked up the
audacity, on this occasion, to ask the colonel for
wine, to keep up their courage, he said. Dyadenko
sat in gloomy silence, Volodya smiled at
something or other, Tchernovitzky declared that
it would infallibly fall to him, Kraut was perfectly
composed.</p>

<p>Volodya was allowed to draw first; he took one
slip, which was rather long, but it immediately
occurred to him to change it; he took another,
which was smaller and thinner, unfolded it, and
read on it, &#8220;I go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has fallen to me,&#8221; he said, with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, God be with you. You will get your
baptism of fire at once,&#8221; said the commander of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the battery, gazing at the perturbed countenance
of the ensign with a kindly smile;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> &#8220;but you must
get there as speedily as possible. And, to make
it more cheerful for you, Vlang shall go with you
as gun-sergeant.&#8221;</p>


<h3>XX.</h3>

<p>Vlang was exceedingly well pleased with the
duty assigned to him, and ran hastily to make his
preparations, and, when he was dressed, he went
to the assistance of Volodya, and tried to persuade
the latter to take his cot and fur coat with him,
and some old &#8220;Annals of the Country,&#8221; and a
spirit-lamp coffee-pot, and other useless things.
The captain advised Volodya to read up his
&#8220;Manual,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> first, about mortar-firing, and immediately
to copy the tables out of it.</p>

<p>Volodya set about this at once, and, to his
amazement and delight, he perceived that, though
he was still somewhat troubled with a sensation of
fear of danger, and still more lest he should turn
out a coward, yet it was far from being to that
degree to which it had affected him on the preceding
evening. The reason for this lay partly in
the daylight and in active occupation, and partly,
principally, also, in the fact that fear and all powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
emotions cannot long continue with the same
intensity. In a word, he had already succeeded
in recovering from his terror.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock, just as the sun had begun to
hide itself behind the Nikolaevsky barracks, the
sergeant came to him, and announced that the
men were ready and waiting for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have given the list to Vlang<i>a</i>. You will
please to ask him for it, Your Honor!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Twenty artillery-men, with side-arms, but without
loading-tools, were standing at the corner of
the house. Volodya and the yunker stepped up
to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I make them a little speech, or shall I
simply say, &#8216;Good day, children!&#8217; or shall I say
nothing at all?&#8221; thought he. &#8220;And why should
I not say, &#8216;Good day, children!&#8217; Why, I ought to
say that much!&#8221; And he shouted boldly, in his
ringing voice:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day, children!&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldiers responded cheerfully. The fresh,
young voice sounded pleasant in the ears of all.
Volodya marched vigorously at their head, in front
of the soldiers, and, although his heart beat as
if he had run several versts at the top of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
speed, his step was light and his countenance
cheerful.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Malakoff mound, and climbing
the slope, he perceived that Vlang, who had
not lagged a single pace behind him, and who had
appeared such a valiant fellow at home in the house,
kept constantly swerving to one side, and ducking
his head, as though all the cannon-balls and
bombs, which whizzed by very frequently in that
locality, were flying straight at him. Some of the
soldiers did the same, and the faces of the majority
of them betrayed, if not fear, at least anxiety.
This circumstance put the finishing touch to Volodya's
composure and encouraged him finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;So here I am also on the Malakoff mound,
which I imagined to be a thousand times more terrible!
And I can walk along without ducking my
head before the bombs, and am far less terrified
than the rest! So I am not a coward, after all?&#8221;
he thought with delight, and even with a somewhat
enthusiastic self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>But this feeling was soon shaken by a spectacle
upon which he stumbled in the twilight, on the
Kornilovsky battery, in his search for the commander
of the bastion. Four sailors standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
near the breastworks were holding the bloody
body of a man, without shoes or coat, by its arms
and legs, and staggering as they tried to fling it
over the ramparts.</p>

<p>(On the second day of the bombardment, it
had been found impossible, in some localities,
to carry off the corpses from the bastions, and
so they were flung into the trench, in order
that they might not impede action in the batteries.)</p>

<p>Volodya stood petrified for a moment, as he
saw the corpse waver on the summit of the
breastworks, and then roll down into the ditch;
but, luckily for him, the commander of the
bastion met him there, communicated his orders,
and furnished him with a guide to the battery and
to the bomb-proofs designated for his service.
We will not enumerate the remaining dangers and
disenchantments which our hero underwent that
evening: how, instead of the firing, such as he had
seen on the Volkoff field, according to the rules of
accuracy and precision, which he had expected to
find here, he found two cracked mortars, one of
which had been crushed by a cannon-ball in the
muzzle, while the other stood upon the splinters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
of a ruined platform; how he could not obtain
any workmen until the following morning in order
to repair the platform; how not a single charge
was of the weight prescribed in the &#8220;Manual;&#8221;
how two soldiers of his command were wounded,
and how he was twenty times within a hair's-breadth
of death.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there had been assigned for his
assistant a gun-captain of gigantic size, a sailor,
who had served on the mortars since the beginning
of the siege, and who convinced him of the
practicability of using them, conducted him all
over the bastion, with a lantern, during the night,
exactly as though it had been his own kitchen-garden,
and who promised to put everything in
proper shape on the morrow.</p>

<p>The bomb-proof to which his guide conducted
him was excavated in the rocky soil, and consisted
of a long hole, two cubic fathoms in extent, covered
with oaken planks an arshin in thickness.
Here he took up his post, with all his soldiers.
Vlang was the first, when he caught sight of the
little door, twenty-eight inches high, of the bomb-proof,
to rush headlong into it, in front of them
all, and, after nearly cracking his skull on the stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
floor, he huddled down in a corner, from which he
did not again emerge.</p>

<p>And Volodya, when all the soldiers had placed
themselves along the wall on the floor, and some
had lighted their pipes, set up his bed in one corner,
lighted a candle, and lay upon his cot, smoking
a cigarette.</p>

<p>Shots were incessantly heard, over the bomb-proof,
but they were not very loud, with the exception
of those from one cannon, which stood close
by and shook the bomb-proof with its thunder.
In the bomb-proof itself all was still; the soldiers,
who were a little shy, as yet, of the new officer,
only exchanged a few words, now and then, as
they requested each other to move out of the way
or to furnish a light for a pipe. A rat scratched
somewhere among the stones, or Vlang, who had
not yet recovered himself, and who still gazed
wildly about him, uttered a sudden vigorous
sigh.</p>

<p>Volodya, as he lay on his bed, in his quiet corner,
surrounded by the men, and illuminated only
by a single candle, experienced that sensation of
well-being which he had known as a child, when,
in the course of a game of hide-and-seek, he used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
to crawl into a cupboard or under his mother's
skirts, and listen, not daring to draw his breath,
and afraid of the dark, and yet conscious of enjoying
himself. He felt a little oppressed, but
cheerful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>


<h3>XXI.</h3>

<p>After the lapse of about ten minutes, the soldiers
began to change about and to converse together.
The most important personages among
them&#8212;the two gun-sergeants&#8212;placed themselves
nearest the officer's light and bed;&#8212;one was old
and gray-haired, with every possible medal and
cross except the George;&#8212;the other was young, a
militia-man, who smoked cigarettes, which he was
rolling. The drummer, as usual, assumed the duty
of waiting on the officer. The bombardiers and
cavalrymen sat next, and then farther away, in the
shadow of the entrance, the <i>underlings</i> took up
their post. They too began to talk among themselves.
It was caused by the hasty entrance of a
man into the casemate.</p>

<p>&#8220;How now, brother! couldn't you stay in the
street? Didn't the girls sing merrily?&#8221; said a
voice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;They sing such marvellous songs as were never
heard in the village,&#8221; said the man who had fled
into the casemate, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Vasin does not love bombs&#8212;ah, no, he
does not love them!&#8221; said one from the aristocratic
corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea! It's quite another matter when
it's necessary,&#8221; drawled the voice of Vasin, who
made all the others keep silent when he spoke:
&#8220;since the 24th, the firing has been going on
desperately; and what is there wrong about it?
You'll get killed for nothing, and your superiors
won't so much as say &#8216;Thank you!&#8217; for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words of Vasin, all burst into a
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's Melnikoff, that fellow who will sit
outside the door,&#8221; said some one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, send him here, that Melnikoff,&#8221; added
the old gunner; &#8220;they will kill him, for a fact,
and that to no purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is this Melnikoff?&#8221; asked Volodya.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Your Honor, he's a stupid soldier of
ours. He doesn't seem to be afraid of anything,
and now he keeps walking about outside.
Please to take a look at him; he looks like a
bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows a spell,&#8221; said the slow voice of
Vasin, from the corner.</p>

<p>Melnikoff entered the bomb-proof. He was fat
(which is extremely rare among soldiers), and a
sandy-complexioned, handsome man, with a huge,
bulging forehead and prominent, light blue eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you afraid of the bombs?&#8221; Volodya
asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there about the bombs to be afraid
of!&#8221; replied Melnikoff, shrugging his shoulders
and scratching his head, &#8220;I know that I shall not
be killed by a bomb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you would like to go on living here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course, I would. It's jolly here!&#8221;
he said, with a sudden outburst of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then you must be detailed for the sortie!
I'll tell the general so, if you like?&#8221; said Volodya,
although he was not acquainted with a single general
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn't I like! I do!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Melnikoff disappeared behind the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let's have a game of <i>noski</i>,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> children! Who
has cards?&#8221; rang out his brisk voice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>
<p>And, in fact, it was not long before a game was
started in the back corner, and blows on the
nose, laughter, and calling of trumps were heard.</p>

<p>Volodya drank some tea from the samovár, which
the drummer served for him, treated the gunners,
jested, chatted with them, being desirous of winning
popularity, and felt very well content with
the respect which was shown him. The soldiers,
too, perceiving that the gentleman put on no airs,
began to talk together.</p>

<p>One declared that the siege of Sevastopol would
soon come to an end, because a trustworthy man
from the fleet had said that the emperor's brother
Constantine was coming to our relief with the
'Merican fleet, and there would soon be an agreement
that there should be no firing for two weeks,
and that a rest should be allowed, and if any one
did fire a shot, every discharge would have to be
paid for at the rate of seventy-five kopeks each.</p>

<p>Vasin, who, as Volodya had already noticed,
was a little fellow, with large, kindly eyes, and
side-whiskers, related, amid a general silence at
first, and afterwards amid general laughter, how,
when he had gone home on leave, they had been
glad at first to see him, but afterwards his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
had begun to send him off to work, and the
lieutenant of the foresters' corps sent his drozhki
for his wife.</p>

<p>All this amused Volodya greatly. He not only
did not experience the least fear or inconvenience
from the closeness and heavy air in the bomb-proof,
but he felt in a remarkably cheerful and
agreeable frame of mind.</p>

<p>Many of the soldiers were already snoring.
Vlang had also stretched himself out on the floor,
and the old gun-sergeant, having spread out his
cloak, was crossing himself and muttering his
prayers, preparatory to sleep, when Volodya took
a fancy to step out of the bomb-proof, and see
what was going on outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take your legs out of the way!&#8221; cried one
soldier to another, as soon as he rose, and the
legs were pressed aside to make way for him.</p>

<p>Vlang, who appeared to be asleep, suddenly
raised his head, and seized Volodya by the skirt
of his coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, don't go! how can you!&#8221; he began, in
a tearfully imploring tone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> &#8220;You don't know
about things yet; they are firing at us out there
all the time; it is better here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, in spite of Vlang's entreaties, Volodya
made his way out of the bomb-proof, and seated
himself on the threshold, where Melnikoff was
already sitting.</p>

<p>The air was pure and fresh, particularly after
the bomb-proof&#8212;the night was clear and still.
Through the roar of the discharges could be heard
the sounds of cart-wheels, bringing gabions, and
the voices of the men who were at work on the
magazine. Above their heads was the lofty, starry
sky, across which flashed the fiery streaks caused
by the bombs; an arshin away, on the left, a tiny
opening led to another bomb-proof, through which
the feet and backs of the soldiers who lived there
were visible, and through which their voices were
audible; in front, the elevation produced by the
powder-vault could be seen, and athwart it flitted
the bent figures of men, and upon it, at the very
summit, amid the bullets and the bombs which
whistled past the spot incessantly, stood a tall
form in a black paletot, with his hands in his
pockets, and feet treading down the earth, which
other men were fetching in sacks. Often a bomb
would fly over, and burst close to the cave. The
soldiers engaged in bringing the earth bent over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
and ran aside; but the black figure never moved;
went on quietly stamping down the dirt with his
feet, and remained on the spot in the same attitude
as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that black man?&#8221; inquired Volodya
of Melnikoff.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know; I will go and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't go! it is not necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Melnikoff, without heeding him, walked up
to the black figure, and stood beside him for a
tolerably long time, as calm and immovable as the
man himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the man who has charge of the magazine,
Your Honor!&#8221; he said, on his return. &#8220;It
has been pierced by a bomb, so the infantry-men
are fetching more earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now and then, a bomb seemed to fly straight
at the door of the bomb-proof. On such occasions,
Volodya shrank into the corner, and then
peered forth again, gazing upwards, to see
whether another was not coming from some direction.
Although Vlang, from the interior of the
bomb-proof, repeatedly besought Volodya to come
back, the latter sat on the threshold for three
hours, and experienced a sort of satisfaction in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
thus tempting fate and in watching the flight of
the bombs. Towards the end of the evening, he
had learned from what point most of the firing
proceeded, and where the shots struck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>


<h3>XXII.</h3>

<p>On the following day, the 27th, after a ten-hours
sleep, Volodya, fresh and active, stepped
out on the threshold of the casement; Vlang
also started to crawl out with him, but, at
the first sound of a bullet, he flung himself backwards
through the opening of the bomb-proof,
bumping his head as he did so, amid the general
merriment of the soldiers, the majority of whom
had also come out into the open air. Vlang, the
old gun-sergeant, and a few others were the only
ones who rarely went out into the trenches; it
was impossible to restrain the rest; they all scattered
about in the fresh morning air, escaping
from the fetid air of the bomb-proof, and, in spite
of the fact that the bombardment was as vigorous
as on the preceding evening, they disposed themselves
around the door, and some even on the
breastworks. Melnikoff had been strolling about
among the batteries since daybreak, and staring
up with perfect coolness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>Near the entrance sat two old soldiers and one
young, curly-haired fellow, a Jew, who had been
detailed from the infantry. This soldier picked
up one of the bullets which were lying about, and,
having smoothed it against a stone with a potsherd,
with his knife he carved from it a cross,
after the style of the order of St. George; the
others looked on at his work as they talked. The
cross really turned out to be quite handsome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if we stay here much longer,&#8221; said one
of them, &#8220;then, when peace is made, the time of
service will be up for all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort; I have at least four
years service yet before my time is up, and I
have been in Sevastopol these five months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not counted towards the discharge, do
you understand,&#8221; said another.</p>

<p>At that moment, a cannon-ball shrieked over
the heads of the speakers, and struck only an
arshin away from Melnikoff, who was approaching
them from the trenches.</p>

<p>&#8220;That came near killing Melnikoff,&#8221; said one
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not be killed,&#8221; said Melnikoff.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here's the cross for you, for your bravery,&#8221;
said the young soldier, who had made the cross,
handing it to Melnikoff.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, brother, a month here counts for a year,
of course&#8212;that was the order,&#8221; the conversation
continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think what you please, but when peace is
declared, there will be an imperial review at
Orshava, and if we don't get our discharge, we
shall be allowed to go on indefinite leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, a shrieking little bullet flew
past the speakers' heads, and struck a stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You'll get a full discharge before evening&#8212;see
if you don't,&#8221; said one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>Not only before evening, but before the expiration
of two hours, two of them received their full
discharge, and five were wounded; but the rest
jested on as before.</p>

<p>By morning, the two mortars had actually been
brought into such a condition that it was possible
to fire them. At ten o'clock, in accordance with
the orders which he had received from the commander
of the bastion, Volodya called out his
command, and marched to the battery with it.</p>

<p>In the men, as soon as they proceeded to action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
there was not a drop of that sentiment of fear
perceptible which had been expressed on the preceding
evening. Vlang alone could not control
himself; he dodged and ducked just as before,
and Vasin lost some of his composure, and fussed
and fidgeted and changed his place incessantly.</p>

<p>But Volodya was in an extraordinary state of
enthusiasm; the thought of danger did not even
occur to him. Delight that he was fulfilling his
duty, that he was not only not a coward, but even
a valiant fellow, the feeling that he was in command,
and the presence of twenty men, who, as he
was aware, were surveying him with curiosity,
made a thoroughly brave man of him. He was
even vain of his valor, put on airs before his soldiers,
climbed up on the banquette, and unbuttoned
his coat expressly that he might render
himself the more distinctly visible.</p>

<p>The commander of the bastion, who was going
the rounds of his establishment as he expressed it,
at the moment, accustomed as he had become
during his eight-months experience to all sorts
of bravery, could not refrain from admiring this
handsome lad, in the unbuttoned coat, beneath
which a red shirt was visible, encircling his soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
white neck, with his animated face and eyes, as he
clapped his hands and shouted: &#8220;First! Second!&#8221;
and ran gayly along the ramparts, in order to see
where his bomb would fall.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven the firing ceased on both
sides, and at precisely twelve o'clock the storming
of the Malakoff mound, of the second, third, and
fifth bastions began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>


<h3>XXIII.</h3>

<p>On this side of the bay, between Inkerman
and the northern fortifications, on the telegraph
hill, about midday, stood two naval men; one was
an officer, who was engaged in observing Sevastopol
through a telescope, and the other had just
arrived at the signal-station with his orderly.</p>

<p>The sun stood high and brilliant above the bay,
and played with the ships which floated upon it,
and with the moving sails and boats, with a warm
and cheerful glow. The light breeze hardly
moved the leaves of the dry oak-shrubs which
stood about the signal-pole, puffed out the sails
of the boats, and ruffled the waves.</p>

<p>Sevastopol, with her unfinished church, her
columns, her line of shore, her boulevard showing
green against the hill, and her elegant library
building, with her tiny azure inlets, filled with
masts, with the picturesque arches of her aqueducts,
and the clouds of blue smoke, lighted up
now and then by red flashes of flame from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
firing; the same beautiful, proud, festive Sevastopol,
hemmed in on one side by yellow, smoke-crowned
hills, on the other by the bright blue sea,
which glittered in the sun, was visible the same as
ever, on the other side of the bay.</p>

<p>Over the horizon-line of the sea, along which
floated a long wreath of black smoke from some
steamer, crept long white clouds, portending a
gale. Along the entire line of the fortifications,
especially over the hills on the left, rose columns
of thick, dense, white smoke; suddenly, abruptly,
and incessantly illuminated by flashes, lightnings,
which shone even amid the light of high noon,
and which constantly increased in volume, assuming
divers forms, as they swept upwards, and
tinged the heavens. These puffs of smoke flashing
now here, now there, took their birth on the
hills, in the batteries of the enemy, in the city,
and high against the sky. The sound of the discharges
never ceased, but shook the air with their
mingled roar.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock, the puffs of smoke began to
occur less and less frequently, and the atmosphere
quivered less with the roar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;But the second bastion is no longer replying
at all,&#8221; said the officer of hussars, who sat there
on horseback; &#8220;it is utterly destroyed! Horrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and the Malakoff only sends one shot to
their three,&#8221; replied the officer who was looking
through his glass. &#8220;It enrages me to have them
silent. They are firing straight on the Kornilovsky
battery, and it is not answering at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you see that they always cease the bombardment
at twelve o'clock, just as I said. It is
the same to-day. Let us go and get some breakfast
... they are already waiting for us ...
there's nothing to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, don't interfere,&#8221; said the officer with the
glass, gazing at Sevastopol with peculiar eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What's going on there? What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a movement in the trenches, and
heavy columns are marching.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is evident,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;The
columns are under way. We must give the
signal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See, see! They have emerged from the
trenches.&#8221;</p>

<p>In truth, it was visible to the naked eye that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
dark masses were moving down the hill, across the
narrow valley, from the French batteries to the
bastions. In front of these specks, dark streaks
were visible, which were already close to our lines.
White puffs of smoke of discharges burst out at
various points on the bastions, as though the firing
were running along the line.</p>

<p>The breeze bore to them the sounds of musketry-shots,
exchanged briskly, like rain upon the
window-pane. The black streaks moved on, nearer
and nearer, into the very smoke. The sounds of
firing grew louder and louder, and mingled in a
lengthened, resounding roar.</p>

<p>The smoke, rising more and more frequently,
spread rapidly along the line, flowed together in
one lilac-hued cloud, which dispersed and joined
again, and through which, here and there, flitted
flames and black points&#8212;and all sounds were
commingled in one reverberating crash.</p>

<p>&#8220;An assault,&#8221; said the officer, with a pale face,
as he handed the glass to the naval officer.</p>

<p>Orderlies galloped along the road, officers on
horseback, the commander-in-chief in a calash,
and his suite passed by. Profound emotion and
expectation were visible on all countenances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;It cannot be that they have taken it!&#8221; said
the mounted officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Heavens, there's the standard! Look,
look!&#8221; said the other, sighing and abandoning the
glass. &#8220;The French standard on the Malakoff!&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;It cannot be!&#8221;</p>


<h3>XXIV.</h3>

<p>The elder Kozeltzoff, who had succeeded in winning
back his money and losing it all again that
night, including even the gold pieces which were
sewed into his cuffs, had fallen, just before daybreak,
into a heavy, unhealthy, but profound slumber,
in the fortified barracks of the fifth battalion,
when the fateful cry, repeated by various voices,
rang out:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;The alarm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you sleeping, Mikhaïl Semyónitch!
There's an assault!&#8221; a voice shouted to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is probably some school-boy,&#8221; he said,
opening his eyes, but putting no faith in it.</p>

<p>But all at once he caught sight of an officer
running aimlessly from one corner to the other,
with such a pale face that he understood it all.
The thought that he might be taken for a coward,
who did not wish to go out to his company at a
critical moment, struck him with terrible force.
He ran to his corps at the top of his speed. Firing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
had ceased from the heavy guns; but the
crash of musketry was at its height. The bullets
whistled, not singly like rifle-balls, but in swarms,
like a flock of birds in autumn, flying past overhead.
The entire spot on which his battalion
had stood the night before was veiled in smoke,
and the shouts and cries of the enemy were audible.
Soldiers, both wounded and unwounded,
met him in throngs. After running thirty paces
further, he caught sight of his company, which
was hugging the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have captured Schwartz,&#8221; said a young
officer. &#8220;All is lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said he, angrily, grasping his
blunt little iron sword, and he began to shout:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward, children! Hurrah!&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice was strong and ringing; it roused
even Kozeltzoff himself. He ran forward along
the traverse; fifty soldiers rushed after him,
shouting as they went. From the traverse he
ran out upon an open square. The bullets fell
literally like hail. Two struck him,&#8212;but where,
and what they did, whether they bruised or
wounded him, he had not the time to decide.</p>

<p>In front, he could already see blue uniforms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
red trousers, and could hear shouts which were
not Russian; one Frenchman was standing on the
breastworks, waving his cap, and shouting something.
Kozeltzoff was convinced that he was
about to be killed; this gave him courage.</p>

<p>He ran on and on. Some soldiers overtook him;
other soldiers appeared at one side, also running.
The blue uniforms remained at the same distance
from him, fleeing back from him to their own
trenches; but beneath his feet were the dead and
wounded. When he had run to the outermost
ditch, everything became confused before Kozeltzoff's
eyes, and he was conscious of a pain in the
breast.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, he was lying on a stretcher,
near the Nikolaevsky barracks, and knew that he
was wounded, though he felt hardly any pain; all
he wanted was something cooling to drink, and to
be allowed to lie still in peace.</p>

<p>A plump little doctor, with black side-whiskers,
approached him, and unbuttoned his coat. Kozeltzoff
stared over his chin at what the doctor was
doing to his wound, and at the doctor's face, but
he felt no pain. The doctor covered his wound
with his shirt, wiped his fingers on the skirts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
his coat, and, without a word or glance at the
wounded man, went off to some one else.</p>

<p>Kozeltzoff's eyes mechanically took note of what
was going on before him, and, recalling the fact
that he had been in the fifth bastion, he thought,
with an extraordinary feeling of self-satisfaction,
that he had fulfilled his duty well, and that, for the
first time in all his service, he had behaved as
handsomely as it was possible for any one, and
had nothing with which to reproach himself. The
doctor, after bandaging the other officer's wound,
pointed to Kozeltzoff, and said something to a
priest, with a huge reddish beard, and a cross, who
was standing near by.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! am I dying?&#8221; Kozeltzoff asked the
priest, when the latter approached him.</p>

<p>The priest, without making any reply, recited a
prayer and handed the cross to the wounded man.</p>

<p>Death had no terrors for Kozeltzoff. He grasped
the cross with his weak hands, pressed it to his
lips, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, were the French repulsed?&#8221; he inquired
of the priest, in firm tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;The victory has remained with us at every
point,&#8221; replied the priest, in order to comfort the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
wounded man, concealing from him the fact that
the French standard had already been unfurled on
the Malakoff mound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; said the wounded man, without
feeling the tears which were trickling down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>The thought of his brother occurred to his
mind for a single instant. &#8220;May God grant him
the same good-fortune,&#8221; he said to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>


<h3>XXV.</h3>

<p>But the same fate did not await Volodya. He
was listening to a tale which Vasin was in the
act of relating to him, when there was a cry,&#8212;&#8220;The
French are coming!&#8221; The blood fled for
a moment to Volodya's heart, and he felt his
cheeks turn cold and pale. For one second he
remained motionless, but, on glancing about him,
he perceived that the soldiers were buttoning up
their coats with tolerable equanimity, and crawling
out, one after the other. One even, probably
Melnikoff, remarked, in a jesting way:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go out and offer them the bread and salt of
hospitality, children!&#8221;</p>

<p>Volodya, in company with Vlang, who never
separated from him by so much as a step, crawled
out of the bomb-proof, and ran to the battery.</p>

<p>There was no artillery firing whatever in progress
on either side. It was not so much the sight
of the soldiers' composure which aroused his courage
as the pitiful and undisguised cowardice of
Vlang.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> &#8220;Is it possible for me to be like him?&#8221;
he said to himself, and he ran on gayly up to the
breastworks, near which his mortars stood. It
was clearly apparent to him that the French
were making straight for him through an open
space, and that masses of them, with their bayonets
glittering in the sun, were moving in the
nearest trenches.</p>

<p>One, a short, broad-shouldered fellow, in zouave
uniform, and armed with a sword, ran on in front
and leaped the ditch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire grape-shot!&#8221; shouted Volodya, hastening
from the banquette; but the soldiers had already
made their preparations without waiting for his
orders, and the metallic sound of the grape-shot
which they discharged shrieked over his head,
first from one and then from the other mortar.</p>

<p>&#8220;First! second!&#8221; commanded Volodya, running
from one mortar to the other, and utterly oblivious
of danger.</p>

<p>On one side, and near at hand, the crash of
musketry from our men under shelter, and anxious
cries, were heard.</p>

<p>All at once a startling cry of despair, repeated
by several voices, was heard on the left:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> &#8220;They
are surrounding us! They are surrounding us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Volodya looked round at this shout. Twenty
Frenchmen made their appearance in the rear.
One of them, a handsome man with a black beard,
was in front of all; but, after running up to within
ten paces of the battery, he halted, and fired
straight at Volodya, and then ran towards him
once more.</p>

<p>For a second, Volodya stood as though turned
to stone, and did not believe his eyes. When he
recovered himself and glanced about him, there
were blue uniforms in front of him on the ramparts;
two Frenchmen were even spiking a cannon
not ten paces distant from him.</p>

<p>There was no one near him, with the exception
of Melnikoff, who had been killed by a bullet
beside him, and Vlang, who, with a handspike
clutched in his hand, had rushed forwards, with
an expression of wrath on his face, and with eyes
lowered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me, Vladímir Semyónitch! Follow
me!&#8221; shouted the desperate voice of Vlang, as he
brandished his handspike over the French, who
were pouring in from the rear. The yunker's
ferocious countenance startled them. He struck
the one who was in advance, on the head; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
others involuntarily paused, and Vlang continued
to glare about him, and to shout in despairing
accents: &#8220;Follow me, Vladímir Semyónitch!
Why do you stand there? Run!&#8221; and ran towards
the trenches in which lay our infantry, firing
at the French. After leaping into the trench,
he came out again to see what his adored ensign
was doing. Something in a coat was lying prostrate
where Volodya had been standing, and the
whole place was filled with Frenchmen, who were
firing at our men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>


<h3>XXVI.</h3>

<p>Vlang found his battery on the second line of
defence. Out of the twenty soldiers who had
been in the mortar battery, only eight survived.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock in the evening, Vlang set out
with the battery on a steamer loaded down with
soldiers, cannon, horses, and wounded men, for
Severnaya.</p>

<p>There was no firing anywhere. The stars shone
brilliantly in the sky, as on the preceding night;
but a strong wind tossed the sea. On the first and
second bastions, lightnings flashed along the earth;
explosions rent the atmosphere, and illuminated
strange black objects in their vicinity, and the
stones which flew through the air.</p>

<p>Something was burning near the docks, and
the red glare was reflected in the water. The
bridge, covered with people, was lighted up by
the fire from the Nikolaevsky battery. A vast
flame seemed to hang over the water, from the
distant promontory of the Alexandrovsky battery,
and illuminated the clouds of smoke beneath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
as it rose above them; and the same tranquil,
insolent, distant lights as on the preceding evening
gleamed over the sea, from the hostile fleet.</p>

<p>The fresh breeze raised billows in the bay. By
the red light of the conflagrations, the masts
of our sunken ships, which were settling deeper
and deeper into the water, were visible. Not a
sound of conversation was heard on deck; there
was nothing but the regular swish of the parted
waves, and the steam, the neighing and pawing of
the horses, the words of command from the captain,
and the groans of the wounded. Vlang, who
had had nothing to eat all day, drew a bit of bread
from his pocket, and began to chew it; but all at
once he recalled Volodya, and burst into such
loud weeping that the soldiers who were near
him heard it.</p>

<p>&#8220;See how our Vlang<i>a</i><a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> is eating his bread and
crying too,&#8221; said Vasin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; said another.</p>

<p>&#8220;And see, they have fired our barracks,&#8221; he
continued, with a sigh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> &#8220;And how many of our
brothers perished there; and the French got it
for nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At all events, we have got out of it alive&#8212;thank
God for that!&#8221; said Vasin.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it's provoking, all the same!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there provoking about it? Do you
suppose they are enjoying themselves there?
Not exactly! You wait, our men will take it
away from them again. And however many of
our brethren perish, as God is holy, if the emperor
commands, they will win it back. Can ours
leave it to them thus? Never! There you have
the bare walls; but they have destroyed all the
breastworks. Even if they have planted their
standard on the hill, they won't be able to make
their way into the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wait, we'll have a hearty reckoning with
you yet, only give us time,&#8221; he concluded, addressing
himself to the French.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we will!&#8221; said another, with conviction.</p>

<p>Along the whole line of bastions of Sevastopol,
which had for so many months seethed with remarkably
vigorous life, which had for so many
months seen dying heroes relieved one after another
by death, and which had for so many months
awakened the terror, the hatred, and finally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
admiration of the enemy,&#8212;on the bastions of
Sevastopol, there was no longer a single man. All
was dead, wild, horrible,&#8212;but not silent.</p>

<p>Destruction was still in progress. On the
earth, furrowed and strewn with the recent explosions,
lay bent gun-carriages, crushing down the
bodies of Russians and of the foe; heavy iron cannons
silenced forever, bombs and cannon-balls
hurled with horrible force into pits, and half-buried
in the soil, then more corpses, pits, splinters of
beams, bomb-proofs, and still more silent bodies in
gray and blue coats. All these were still frequently
shaken and lighted up by the crimson
glow of the explosions, which continued to shock
the air.</p>

<p>The foe perceived that something incomprehensible
was going on in that menacing Sevastopol.
Those explosions and the death-like silence on
the bastions made them shudder; but they dared
not yet believe, being still under the influence of
the calm and forcible resistance of the day, that
their invincible enemy had disappeared, and they
awaited motionless and in silence the end of
that gloomy night.</p>

<p>The army of Sevastopol, like the gloomy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
surging sea, quivering throughout its entire
mass, wavering, ploughing across the bay, on
the bridge, and at the north fortifications,
moved slowly through the impenetrable darkness
of the night; away from the place where it had
left so many of its brave brethren, from the place
all steeped in its blood, from the place which it
had defended for eleven months against a foe twice
as powerful as itself, and which it was now ordered
to abandon without a battle.</p>

<p>The first impression produced on every Russian
by this command was inconceivably sad. The
second feeling was a fear of pursuit. The men
felt that they were defenceless as soon as they
abandoned the places on which they were accustomed
to fight, and they huddled together
uneasily in the dark, at the entrance to the
bridge, which was swaying about in the heavy
breeze.</p>

<p>The infantry pressed forward, with a clash of
bayonets, and a thronging of regiments, equipages,
and arms; cavalry officers made their way about
with orders, the inhabitants and the military servants
accompanying the baggage wept and besought
to be permitted to cross, while the artillery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
in haste to get off, forced their way to the bay
with a thunder of wheels.</p>

<p>In spite of the diversions created by the varied
and anxious demands on their attention, the
instinct of self-preservation and the desire to
escape as speedily as possible from that dread
place of death were present in every soul. This
instinct existed also in a soldier mortally wounded,
who lay among the five hundred other wounded,
upon the stone pavement of the Pavlovsky quay,
and prayed God to send death; and in the
militia-man, who with his last remaining strength
pressed into the compact throng, in order to make
way for a general who rode by, and in the general
in charge of the transportation, who was engaged
in restraining the haste of the soldiers, and in the
sailor, who had become entangled in the moving
battalion, and who, crushed by the surging throng,
had lost his breath, and in the wounded officer,
who was being borne along in a litter by four soldiers,
who, stopped by the crowd, had placed him
on the ground by the Nikolaevsky battery, and in
the artillery-man, who had served his gun for sixteen
years, and who, at his superior's command,
to him incomprehensible, to throw overboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
the guns, had, with the aid of his comrades, sent
them over the steep bank into the bay; and
in the men of the fleet, who had just closed the
port-holes of the ships, and had rowed lustily
away in their boats. On stepping upon the further
end of the bridge, nearly every soldier pulled
off his cap and crossed himself.</p>

<p>But behind this instinct there was another, oppressive
and far deeper, existing along with it; this
was a feeling which resembled repentance, shame,
and hatred. Almost every soldier, as he gazed
on abandoned Sevastopol, from the northern shore,
sighed with inexpressible bitterness of heart, and
menaced the foe.</p>
